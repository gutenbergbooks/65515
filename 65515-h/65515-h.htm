<p>The following Report contains a summary of investigations
of a Committee, appointed by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, at Southampton, in 1882,
to consist of Professor Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown,
Mr. John Cordeaux, Mr. Philip M. C. Kermode, Mr. K. M.
Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining
(with the consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the
Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and
the Commissioners of Irish Lights) observations on the
Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Lightships, and of
reporting upon the same at Southport in 1883. Mr.
Cordeaux to be the Secretary.</p>

<p>An abstract of the Report was read by Mr. John Cordeaux
at the Meeting of the Association, held at Southport, in
September, 1883.</p>

<p>The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by
Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown; for the East Coast of England,
by Mr. Cordeaux; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by
Mr. R. M. Barrington and Mr. A. G. More.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faroe.</span>&mdash;From Faroe, thanks to Herr M&uuml;ller, we have the
following Report:&mdash;In spring one <i>Recurvirostra avocetta</i> was seen
on May 30th, and two Arctic Terns on same day; wind W., and
sunshine. Of <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>, <i>&#338;demia nigra</i> occurred on May 15th at
Str&oacute;m&oacute;, and two, male and female, on 27th at same place.
Two also, male and female, seen at same place in the plumage of
the second year at Kalbat, Str&oacute;m&oacute;, on June 2nd. In autumn,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
taking certain occurrences after the middle of June as
"autumn man&#339;uvres,"&mdash;of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i>, six or more Fieldfares
were killed or seen at Thorshavn on Dec. 7th, easterly breezes
having prevailed. Of <i>Phylloscopin&aelig;</i>, a rush of <i>Regulus cristatus</i>
appears to have taken place on Oct. 21st, as many were seen at
Thorshavn and elsewhere, and dead ones brought to Herr
M&uuml;ller. One dead Robin was brought from Kollefjord, and
several more had been seen on the same date. One <i>Caprimulgus
europ&aelig;us</i> was sent from Gauredal on June 16th. <i>Loxia curvirostra</i>
appeared round Thorshavn for several days, and are
recorded on June 29th, and again on July 9th, on which latter
date those killed with stones at Tofle were in good condition.
One Common Swift was caught on board a fishing-smack midway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">-2-</span>
between Iceland and Faroe, also on June 29th. One White
Wagtail, <i>Motacilla alba</i>, appeared with N. wind on July 30th.
One female Roller, <i>Coracias garrula</i>, was shot at Thorshavn on
July 22nd, wind E., and one Pomatorhine Skua was seen on
July 25th. One Woodcock was shot in Vaag&oacute;, Suder&oacute;, during a
S.E. storm, in clear weather; and of <i>Cygnid&aelig;</i>, in all eleven&mdash;4
and 7&mdash;Wild Swans flew past high in air from N.W. to S.E.
on Nov. 5th. On Nov. 4th was N.E. wind, but on 5th N.W. and
W. and showery. The prevailing winds at the Faroe Isles were
easterly; in October, from the 7th to the end of the month,
steady easterly and S.E.</p>

<p>The ordinary papers, &amp;c., were sent to thirty stations on the
East Coast of Scotland, Faroe, and Iceland, as was done in
1881.</p>

<p>Twelve stations on this coast have returned filled-in schedules,&mdash;the
same number as in 1881,&mdash;out of the twenty-six East
Scotch stations. As formerly, many returns are light, but those
from Isle of May, Pentland Skerries, and Sumburgh Head are
fuller than before, again indicating favourite highway's of migration.
Bell Rock returns are also very full, but not so full as Isle
of May nor Pentland Skerries. From Isle of May alone I have
no less than nineteen schedules, and I have also to thank
Mr. Agnew for a jar of forty-three specimens of birds, besides
others sent me in the flesh or carbolised. At another time I
intend to write more fully concerning the birds of the Isle of
May, which is a locality of special interest to the student of
migration.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From the Pentland Skerries I have nine filled-in
schedules, and from Sumburgh Head four; from the Bell Rock
three closely-filled schedules.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I intend to present the collection of birds formed on the Isle of
May to that station, to lie there in the skin, and serve both to identify
birds in future and to be of interest to visitors who annually visit the Isle
of May.</p>

</div>

<p>Here follows the usual list of stations issued with each
Report on the same plan as before, the dates of years upon
which the various stations have sent in Reports being shown by
asterisks.</p>

<p>Our thanks are especially due to those observers who have
noted, as far as possible, the <i>directions of flight</i> of the birds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">-3-</span>
noticed. If this were done at all the stations returning schedules
it would in a marked degree assist our generalisations.</p>

<p class="tdc">(<i>a</i>) Describes a bird but no schedule.</p>


<p>It will be seen from the above that there is a long extent of
coast-line whence I have scarcely received any returns since the
beginning of the scheme, <i>viz.</i>, in Aberdeenshire. Is this always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">-4-</span>
due to actual scarcity of birds there, or to want of observing and
recording? I cannot tell, as I never receive any communications
positive or negative from these stations, except from Girdleness,
whence last year I had a brief return. At Montroseness scarcity
of birds, indeed almost utter absence, is the reason of no returns
in most years, and we can hardly ever expect much from it owing
to its position&mdash;"So near the town and all the paraphernalia of
commerce," as Mr. P. E. Reid, the lighthouse-keeper, informs
me. He says, "I have never been at a station where fewer birds
come near the light; not over half a dozen for the past year, and
these were, we suspect. Gulls." At Noss Head, Mr. Alex. Greig,
not knowing the names of some of the birds, thought it "better
not to send in a report that would be incorrect"; but if he sends
me in a report on those he does know the name of; or some dates,
and the winds prevailing at the time of great rushes of birds,
without the names of the birds, such would be very useful.
"Small birds" or "large birds" have a value to me in recording,
though the names are not given. That a migration was
observable in 1882 at Noss Head is a <i>fact</i>, obtained from Mr.
Greig's reply to my post-card, and may prove a useful fact in
arriving some day at conclusions.</p>

<p>I fear it is not to be expected that we get any returns from
the Whaling Captains, the arduous duties they are engaged in
making them always too glad of complete rest when obtainable.
Our thanks are due to Mr. T. Southwell, however, for speaking
to some of them on the subject; our own application, by
distributing circulars at Dundee with the assistance of Mr. P.
Henderson, naturalist of that town, not having produced any
results.</p>

<p>I have received occasional notes from Mr. Anderson's log,
through Mr. R. Gray (see <a href="#Gannet"><span class="smcap">Gannet</span></a>, &amp;c.). Mr. Anderson has
again taken duty on an Atlantic Liner, after a temporary
engagement in the Mediterranean, so we may hope to hear
further of him and his observations.</p>

<p>As before, notes I have received from other sources besides
the lighthouses I will enter after the paragraphs on each species
or group. These are to be taken simply as corroborative evidence,
or otherwise, of the lighthouse reports, or as supplementary to
them.</p>

<p>Notes have been kept upon about twenty-two species of Waterfowl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">-5-</span>
fifty-three species of land birds, and about eight or ten
species of littoral birds or waders, by our reporters on the East
Coast.</p>

<p>Spring Migration I have kept distinct in this Report.</p>

<p>I have not given compiled notes on weather in this place this
year, as all that requires to be said will be found under the
treatment of the species, and a short paragraph under General
Remarks.</p>

<p>The whole space of time included by our 1882 returns runs
from February in spring onwards, and in autumn from July to
January 27th, 1883, the date of the last returned schedules. In
the General Remarks I notice briefly the spring migration of
1883&mdash;at Isle of May, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I visited this year Buchan Ness Lighthouse, on the Aberdeenshire
coast, and Mr. Andrew Gallie showed me a Manx Shearwater
which he had found dead on the balcony in the winter of
1879&mdash;80. Mr. Geo. Sim, who was with me at the time, told me
it was the first he had ever had record of on the N.E. coast of
Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>I visited also Cape Wrath Lighthouse. There, I was told,
very few birds are ever seen at the lights, owing to its great
height above the sea.</p>

<p id="Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, at Isle of May, March 2nd, after E. to
S.E. gale for twenty-four hours, a few Redwings (accompanied by
Lapwings, Reed Buntings, Rooks, and Hooded Crows among land
birds, and Eider Duck, Teal, and Black Guillemots amongst
water-birds). At same station, on April 8th and 19th, with E.
winds. Redwings appeared; and on April 15th and 28th, single
specimens of Ring Ouzels, again with strong E. or N.E. winds
(see <a href="#Land_Notes">Land Notes</a> <i>infra</i>). In autumn, no records till September;
then at Whalsey, N. Ronaldshay, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries,
Dunnet Head, Bell Rock, Isle of May (max.), from Sept. 20th,
records on to Jan. 25th, 1883&mdash;the last record at N. Ronaldshay.
The earliest, Sept. 20th, was at Isle of May. All the species
recorded occurred all throughout the season, <i>viz.</i>, Fieldfares,
Redwings, Missel Thrushes (min.). Common Thrushes (max.).
Blackbirds; but Fieldfares and Redwings also very abundant.
Rushes, first at Auskerry and at N. Ronaldshay on Sept. 27th,
and indications of the same also at Pentland Skerries and Isle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">-6-</span>
May. Numbers of Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Missel Thrushes
frequented N. Ronaldshay for three days after this date. At the
northern stations, wind strong S.E.; at Isle of May, N.E. gale. A
vast rush of many species took place, commencing on Oct. 8th, and
continued till about the 18th in force at all the stations sending
in returns, except Auskerry. We will speak fully of this movement
in this place, and afterwards will refer back to it under
other species. Migration general over whole coast-line. Wind
during that time was N.E. to S.E. to E., with fog and rain; on
the 16th S. at southern stations, and generally S.E. over all the
coast. But at Pentland Skerries, mod. S. and S.W. on 10th,
11th, and 13th. The rush here on 12th was, however, with
S.S.E. fresh, and fog. At N. Ronaldshay, on 7th&mdash;8th, numbers
of Thrushes were seen coming from the S.E., and more continued
coming till the 16th, all the time with strong S.E. wind. On
16th wind changed to S., and all left. All stations send in
heavy returns; but the heaviest is from Isle of May, and
hundreds were seen at Bell Rock on the 12th-14th. A desultory
migration, with frequent rushes, was kept up all October; also
all November, the following dates bulking largest, <i>viz.</i>, Nov. 5th,
9th, 12th, 18th, and 27th, the northerly stations of Sumburgh
Head and Pentland Skerries having during this month heavier
returns on the whole than the more southerly ones. Wind during
this time at Sumburgh Head fresh W., when fifty Redwings
appeared on 5th. But at same place, light N.N.E. on 9th, when
thirty Redwings were seen. On 27th, at same place, twenty-five
Redwings were seen flying S.W., with wind fresh W.; and at
Isle of May, on 18th, several flocks of Fieldfares and Ring Ouzels&mdash;which
usually appear here together&mdash;appeared with fresh S.
breeze. All during the intermediate time between the above
dates migration was carried on. In December the same continued,
but in diminishing numbers; and an indication of a
small rush occurred between the 6th and 12th, but this appeared
to be greatly due to N.E. gales accompanied by snow-storms and
severe frost on the mainland, causing local migration, as is partly
evident from the species accompanying them, such as Larks, &amp;c.,
and the exhausted and emaciated appearance, especially of the
Redwings, even on the Isle of May. Between the 15th and 31st,
at Auskerry, a great flock of Buntings was seen daily. In
January large flocks were seen from 4th on to date of last entries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span>
in the schedules, and as late as 25th. Fieldfares at Pentland Skerries,
where the most were seen on the 13th. At N. Ronaldshay,
also, many Blackbirds, Common Thrushes, and Missel Thrushes
up to 24th, as already stated. Having detailed the movements,
and given dates and circumstances of these rushes, I will now
name the species which, along with Thrushes of various kinds,
participated in the movement, and this may serve as indicating
the general lines of 1882. During the September rush we shall
have occasion to refer amongst others to the following species or
groups of species:&mdash;<i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> (which began to move, however,
as early as August), some <i>Silviin&aelig;</i> (as Robin, Whitethroat, &amp;c.).
Golden-crested Wrens and <i>Phylloscopin&aelig;</i> (end of August), <i>Parid&aelig;</i>,
<i>Motacillid&aelig;</i>, Pied Flycatchers, Swallows, <i>Fringillid&aelig;</i>, <i>Emberizid&aelig;</i>,
<i>Alaudid&aelig;</i>, as also references throughout to Hawks, Owls, Herons,
and sea-birds. During the great October rush, between 8th and
18th or 23rd, at the Isle of May, during thick fog and S.E. to E.
winds, Mr. Agnew describes the movement as beyond comparison
with any former experience of his. A vast rush of Bramblings,
Chaffinches, Golden-crested Wrens without number, <i>Silviin&aelig;</i>,
Robins, Hedge Accentors, Siskins, Larks, Redwings, Ring Ouzels,
Woodcocks, Blackcaps (a few). Sedge Warblers, Jack Snipes;
and this movement continued in pulsing throbs and also continuously,
covering all October, November, and December, and
far into 1883. For night after night hundreds of thousands of
small birds circled round the lanterns, flying "against the sun"
at Isle of May. From the Isle of May alone, as already stated, I
have nineteen schedules filled to overflowing with Mr. Agnew's
careful records. A separate paper on the Isle of May, which
I hope to prepare when I have leisure, is the only way to
do justice to the locality and its recorder. Curious that, although
such vast numbers were seen at Isle of May, the numbers at the
more inland station, or rather more landlocked station, of Inch
Keith show quite a small numerical return; but of these matters
I shall have more to say in my General Remarks. Six species of
<i>Turdid&aelig;</i> occur recorded in the East Coast returns.
<a id="Land_Notes"></a><i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Mr. J. T. Garrioch, writing to me under date March
13th, 1883, and remarking upon the vast nature of the general
migration between Oct. 8th and 25th, during an E. to S.E. gale,
mentions a few Fieldfares and one Thrush on the 9th which
seemed much exhausted. In spring of 1882, Fieldfares remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span>
late into April in Stirlingshire. A flock was seen among the foothills
of the Denny range by myself on April 16th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, Wheatears ("Stonechats" must be
included here.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Another season Mr. Agnew will be able to
distinguish between true Stonechats and Wheatears, and I hope
other reporters also). Whinchats, Redstarts: First record
(Wheatear) at Isle of May, March 29th, strong W. wind, clear;
latest (Redstart) June 29th, light E., fog. But this may belong
to autumn; next latest (Redstart) May 24th, at Isle of May.
Earliest Wheatear March 29th; latest, and a rush, on May 2nd
(along with other birds unknown), N.E., rain and fog, at Bell
Rock. A large bird struck heavily, and fell into the sea. Rush
of Wheatears, April 5th. Earliest Whinchat, March 29th;
latest and rush, on April 15th, at Isle of May. Earliest Redstart,
April 2nd, at Isle of May; latest June 29th, and next May 24th.
No great rush apparent. Of the above, Whinchats are also
named "Blue Janets," a name usually applied, however, to the
Hedgesparrow or Hedge Accentor. The record of June 29th, of
a Redstart in light E. wind, seems more of an accidental nature,
as it is separated from the one before by a month, and from the
true autumn migration by six weeks. Three species of <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i>
on East Coast in spring. In autumn, the same species. Records
from Whalsey, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock,
Isle of May, and Inch Keith. (Note.&mdash;These are the same stations
that reported last season.) Earliest Stonechat, and earliest record,
at Bell Rock on Aug. 9th, light S. breeze and fog; latest Stonechat
Sept. 22nd, also at Bell Rock. Indications of a rush at Pentland
Skerries on Sept. 3rd. "Blue Janets" participated in the
October rush already spoken of (see under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>). Earliest
Wheatear, Aug. 17th, at Pentland Skerries; latest Sept. 17th.
Earliest Redstart Sept. 15th; latest Oct. 22nd. No additional
species of <i>Saxicolin&aelig;</i> appeared in autumn.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> In so far as the records apply at Isle of May.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, Robins at Bell Rock only; one seen on
April 10th, struck lantern, but not killed. But "unusual numbers"
were seen at Isle of May in April, and in spring generally.
In autumn, Robins at Sumburgh Head (where they are very
rarely seen), N. Ronaldshay, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head,
Chanonry, Bell Rock, Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Earliest at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
Isle of May, Aug. 18th; latest at Chanonry, Dec. 20th, where
one rested two days. No quantity till vast rush of October, when
Mr. Agnew says he never saw so many Robins before. Greatest
numbers seen on 12th. Enormous and uncommon numbers also
on 18th at Isle of May, and all gone on 23rd. Large rush on
12th also at Pentland Skerries, when numbers seen all day flying
S.W. Indications of the same movement also at N. Ronaldshay,
and to a less extent at Sumburgh Head (see under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>).
Of other <i>Silviin&aelig;</i>, in spring, a few Whitethroats (identified from
a specimen in spirits) showed at Isle of May on May 6th, and in
autumn a rush took place at same place on Aug. 16th (specimen
No. 33 in spirits); but I have no other records. A single Blackcap
on Oct. 14th participated in the rush at Isle of May. Three
species of <i>Silviin&aelig;</i> occurred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;A marvellous migration of Golden-crested
Regulus both in spring and autumn. In spring, the only station
giving returns is Isle of May, where Mr. Agnew says they are
very unusual at this season. Earliest on March 9th, when one
was seen at lights. Large numbers; a rush on 19th and one bird
on 20th. All March records accompanied by N.W. through W. to
S.W. winds. The rush took place with light S.W., and rain.
Three other records are on April 1st, 4th, and 10th; a rush on
the 10th of females; the males preceded the females by some
weeks. Migration in spring thus lasted from March 9th to April
10th. In autumn, at Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland
Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest on Aug. 27th, at
Isle of May; latest at same station on Nov. 12th. Rushes:
steady influx all September after the 13th; a solitary bird on
Oct. 4th; a rush on 8th, indicated at Sumburgh Head and
Pentland Skerries. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;This is their first appearance here
for five years; it is marked "very rare" at Sumburgh Head, and
indeed natives had not seen them before). More decided at Bell
Rock, where they accompanied Bullfinches and Pipits on the
12th, and at Isle of May. The body of the rush occupied three
days, from the 8th to the 12th; during that time, at Isle of May,
Mr. Agnew describes their numbers as "enormous." Of other
<i>Phylloscopin&aelig;</i>, Leaf-warblers&mdash;the species, however, not always
recognisable from descriptions&mdash;were fairly abundant. In spring,
one record of either a Wood or Willow Warbler (probably the
latter) on May 24th at Isle of May. In autumn, the Isle of May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span>
again produces all the records I have, the earliest being considerable
numbers of Chiffchaffs (identified) on Aug. 9th, a few
on Sept. 13th, 17th, and 27th, at Isle of May; a rush on Oct.
7th, 8th, and 9th, and all gone on 10th; a few on 14th, and all
finally gone on 15th. Three (or four?) species of <i>Phylloscopin&aelig;</i>
recorded on East Coast. Land <i>Notes.</i>&mdash;On April 24th one
Willow Warbler seen at Shirgarton, ten miles W. of Stirling.
Mr. Garrioch, writing from Lerwick, says:&mdash;"In the evening of
Oct. 9th my attention was called to a large flock of birds crossing
the harbour from the Island of Bressay, and on coming to a spot
on the shore where a large number had taken refuge from the
storm I found the flock to consist of Goldcrests, and a few Firecrests
amongst them. They continued to increase in numbers
for a few days, and several specimens were sent to me for preservation
from distant parts of the islands." These were preceded
on the 8th by flocks of Willow Wrens, one flock numbering about
twenty. "The Goldcrests spread over the entire islands, and were
observed in considerable numbers till the middle of November,
when they all disappeared." Subsequently, Mr. Garrioch, writing
to me in reply to certain queries as to the authenticity of the
"Fire-crested Wrens," says:&mdash;"Of one flock of Goldcrests, I
observed five birds which I thought to be the Firecrest.
I obtained one specimen very distinctly marked. It seemed
to me that the Firecrests were very much more exhausted
by the storm than the Goldcrests." <i>Note.</i>&mdash;I had in my letter
shown the distinction between the male Goldcrest and the
true Firecrest, the male Goldcrest having a mark above and
below the eye, without the black line <i>through</i> the eye, the
Firecrest showing three bars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In Spring, at Isle of May, Mr. Agnew
believes he identifies "Reed Warblers" on April 4th; his
description, however, would equally apply perhaps to Whitethroats
or to Sedge Warblers. In autumn, a rush of similar
birds took place there on Oct. 9th. Perhaps two species
recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentorin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In March, "Blue Janets," of Mr. Agnew,
which are represented by a Whinchat in spirits, but which name
in Scotland is correctly applied only to the Hedgesparrow or
Hedge Accentor. In autumn, one "Blue Janet" on Dec. 3rd.
Whilst it is the most abundant of migratory species in autumn on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span>
the E. English Coast, next to the Goldcrest, it is curious to find
scarcely any records on our E. Scotch Coast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Titmice: In spring, one record ("the first seen on
the lantern for many years ") at Cromarty, on March 11th,
fresh W. and clear. In autumn, considerable numbers of Titmice
at Isle of May on Aug. 9th; occurred at Whalsey, N. Ronaldshay
(in Oct., Nov., and Dec.), Pentland Skerries, Isle of May,
and Inch Keith. Earliest as above, Aug. 9th, at Isle of May;
latest at N. Ronaldshay, between Dec. 6th and 12th, when a few
came with Robins in a snow-storm (probably local movement
only); they accompanied Robins and Thrushes also at N. Ronaldshay
on Nov. 12th; on Oct. 12th about sixteen stayed four days,
and left on 16th; this is the only indication of a rush. Number
of species of <i>Parid&aelig;</i> unknown. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;On Sept. 6th I
heard Marsh Tit in our woods at Dunipace; this is the earliest
autumn record I have, but spring records I have at other
localities in the county.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Common Wren: One species. A few records
in autumn from Sumburgh Head, Bressay, Pentland Skerries,
N. Ronaldshay, and Isle of May; earliest one seen for a
moment on island. At Sumburgh Head on Aug. 11th, and three
on 12th; latest at Pentland Skerries on Dec. 7th, wind N.E.,
clear. Rush quite marked on Oct. 10th at Isle of May, still not
numerous; also at N. Ronaldshay, on Nov. 12th, a few came
with Robins and Thrushes, and a few on same day came also
with Robins and Thrushes to Isle of May, wind easterly. <i>Land
Notes.</i>&mdash;Mr. Garrioch obtained one male Creeper on Oct. 12th,
caught on Bressay with Great Spotted Woodpeckers, "all seeming
much the worse of the storm."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, at Whalsey, Bell Rock, and Isle of
May; in all five records. Earliest Feb. 24th, at Isle of May,
light W. wind; latest at Whalsey, May 24th ("Grey Wagtail,"
marked "very rare here"). At Bell Rock all birds leave at high
tide, being drowned off. In autumn, records from Whalsey,
Sumburgh Head, and Isle of May. Earliest from 23rd to 26th,
a flock of "Grey Wagtails" flying about island, and on 27th
seven seen all day on Pentland Skerries; latest on Isle of May,
one Pied Wagtail on Nov. 7th. No rush very apparent. On Sept.
20th, Mr. J. Agnew has the record, "at Isle of May, three, N.E.
gale, one very white in colour and one very black "; and on Oct. 31st<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span>
the further record, "two, one very white, the other dark." We
would like specimens of these "very white Wagtails." Possibly
records relate to three species, but it will be safer only to include
one at present. Titlarks (Rock Pipits?) arrived in large numbers
on Isle of May on March 9th, and "supplemented some half dozen
that remained all winter." N.B. The ones that remained are
probably "Rock Pipits" (<i>Anthus obscurus</i>), and the additions are
probably "Meadow Pip its" (<i>A. pratensis</i>). In autumn, at Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May; earliest,
one at Isle of May ("Mosscheeper," J. Agnew; or Meadow Pipit,
J. A. H. B.); latest, Bell Rock, Oct. 9th, "Mosscheeper," Mr. Jack;
on this occasion mixed with Bullfinches. Rush on Sept. 4th, at
Sumburgh Head, large flocks of "Rock Larks," <i>auct.</i> John
Wilson; and a constant stream of the same on 15th, along with
Larks. Desultory migration during September; only one record,
curiously enough, in October. Two species of <i>Anthin&aelig;</i> (<i>Motacillid&aelig;</i>)
noticed. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;See remarks on land migration of the
Pied Wagtail at end of the General Remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laniid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;One record, on Oct. 16th, at Isle of May; one bird
accompanied rush of Oct. 8th and 18th, strong S. after S.E.
One species recorded&mdash;the Great Grey Shrike. <i>Notes.</i>&mdash;A male
Great Grey Shrike killed at Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire
(illustrates line across central districts of Scotland), Feb. 3rd,
1883; about 1st Nov., 1882, three Great Grey Shrikes (two male
and one female), and one same date at Redcastle. Rosshire
('Scotsman,' Feb. 17th, 1883); the last great appearance of this
species was in 1873&mdash;74. A golden Oriole (<i>Oriolus galbula</i>) occurred
during the October migration at Lerwick, along with two
Spotted Woodpeckers, a Tree Creeper, and the Golden-crested
Wrens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muscicapid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Pied Flycatcher: three records at Isle of
May on Aug. 15th, one female, light S., rain and fog; on Sept.
15th one female struck and killed; on Nov. 7th one male flying
S., but obtained, fresh S.W. breeze. One species. <i>Notes.</i>&mdash;Two
Waxwings, a very fine male and a female, killed at Kinneil by
Mr. D. Nichol, gamekeeper to Mr. Russell, Dundee Castle, on
Jan. 18th, 1883. Kinneil is close to Bo'ness, at the head of the
Firth of Forth. This female is one of the very finest birds I ever
saw. Out of the hundreds examined in the frozen marts of St.
Petersburg and Moscow I only saw one to equal it, the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">-13-</span>
of the wax-like appendages being very great on both wings
and tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring Swallows appeared at Whalsey,
Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Cromarty, Isle of
May, and Inch Keith. Earliest at Isle of May, April 22nd, and
more on 23rd. Latest at same place, on June 26th. Rush
perceptible at Isle of May, May 11th to 17th, when a steady
migration in small numbers were observed flying N., wind W. to
S.E. All Swallows seen have been during the forenoon. Sand
Martin on May 9th, at Whalsey Skerries. In autumn, at same
stations, continuous records from June, many no doubt relating
to local movements, therefore perhaps somewhat difficult to
separate spring and autumn records. On July 3rd and 4th,
however, at Auskerry, flocks were seen at noon; wind light
S. to S.E. Martins are noted from Whalsey, and Auskerry
and Pentland Skerries; and Sand Martin from Isle of May
on Aug. 24th. All other records apply to Common Swallows.
Swallows resident at Cromarty disappeared on Sept. 1st. No
great rushes very apparent. Latest on Oct. 6th, at Sumburgh
Head; next, on Oct. 2nd, at Isle of May; strong S.W. wind.
Three species noticed. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;In spring, first Swallow
seen by M. P. Kermode and myself at Dunipace, on April 23rd;
and same day, at Shirgarton, by another party. None seen on
16th, when Bidwell and I were out, and when we took a Dipper's
nest and four eggs. On 26th, Mr. K. Gray saw two Martins in
Edinburgh. Swallows and Sand Martins were first seen at
Kelso, on the Tweed, on April 16th (<i>auct.</i> J. J. Armistead, Esq.).
See also General Remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, great movements of many species
of Finches, both in spring and autumn, comprising the following
species:&mdash;Green and Grey Linnets, Chaffinches, Bramblings,
Siskins, Redpolls, House Sparrows, Tree Sparrows, Bullfinches,
the Green and Grey Linnets predominating, and occurring at
the following stations:&mdash;Spring, almost entirely monopolised at
Isle of May; Siskins also appearing at Inch Keith. From March
3rd on to May 22nd. Only indication of unusual rush perhaps
on March 17th and 18th (Green Linnets and Chaffinches). Prevailing
wind at Isle of May all April, many birds appearing, S.E.,
except on April 25th, when there were no birds, the wind shifting
round to N.E. suddenly. In autumn, at Isle of May, a solitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">-14-</span>
Green Linnet appeared on July 14th. The above species showed
at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, Isle of May,
and Inch Keith. Earliest, Grey Linnets, Aug. 23rd, at Isle of
May. Latest, at same spot, on Dec. 8th. Vast rush in October
(9th to 23). Green Linnets, earliest somewhat later than the
last, but the rush about same time. Chaffinches, no records till
Oct. 10th, at Sumburgh Head, where it is only seen on migration.
The great rush of Chaffinches, as compared with other
species, apparent, but movement distinct in October. Brambling,
no records till Oct. 10th, when a rush past was made, and no
more seen again till Dec. 3rd, when one was seen. Nine Siskins,
a considerable movement; earliest, Aug. 7th, at Isle of May;
latest, Oct. 16th. The rush of this species took place on Sept.
27th and 28th, when scores, mostly females, were on Isle of
May; and they also showed at Inch Keith. A rush, however,
also took place about Oct. 16th. Redpolls appear not quite so
abundantly in the records as other species. The records are in
September and December. A rush of Tree Sparrows took place
at Isle of May, where Mr. Agnew says he does not remember
seeing this species before. One was captured on Oct. 15th. A
very few House Sparrows were noticed in October. A few Bullfinches
showed at Bell Rock, accompanied by Pipits and Golden-crested
Wrens, &amp;c., on Oct. 9th to 12th. The records take me
up to Dec. 12th for <i>Fringillid&aelig;</i>. Nine species of <i>Fringillid&aelig;</i>
under notice. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;On Oct. 8th a flock of about fifty
Mealy Redpolls, all males, kept flying round about Lerwick, at
the same time with a few Willow Wrens, one flock numbering
twenty.&mdash;(J. T. G.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, the February records may apply to
last Report as regards Snow Buntings. They were uncommonly
numerous at Isle of May in 1881-82. Large flocks seen flying
S. there on Feb. 22nd, and also on 13th and 24th. On March
1st large numbers, taking on the summer plumage, or mostly
adults, after a gale of twenty-four hours, from E. to S.E. (<i>Vide</i>
under <span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span> of this date; same remarks apply here.) Same
day, one Reed Bunting. Snow Buntings continued to show at
intervals all March; two showed on April 15th at Isle of May.
None were seen in May. In autumn, the records are numerous
of Snow Buntings from most of the stations sending returns;
perhaps most so at Pentland Skerries in November. Do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
bulk so largely at Isle of May. Earliest Sept. 19th, at Isle
of May (the remark, "too early," appended by Mr. Agnew).
No great rush in October along with the other species, but
bulking largely in November at Sumburgh Head, where 250
showed in three compact flocks on 6th; also at Pentland
Skerries abundant all through the month, but maximum about
the 10th, when fully 1000 were all day on the Island; winds
N.E. to E. and S.E., with some calm days and variable. About
this time departing flocks seen to fly off S.W. and flocks seen to
arrive from the N.E. over the sea. Snow Buntings seem to
arrive at Dunnet Head more frequently with W. and S.W. winds,
and also to a considerable extent with similar wind at Pentland
Skerries. This has been remarked before. After sharp frosts
and N.E. snow-storms they soon appear. Common Bunting is
reported from Isle of May for the first time on Dec. 19th;
Yellow Buntings appeared occasionally in reports at Isle of
May; and the first recorded occurrence at Pentland Skerries on
Dec. 17th and 19th. One remained a week singly&mdash;a female&mdash;on
Isle of May up to Nov. 4th. Four species of Buntings
appear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring the Skylark is reported "very rare" at
Whalsey; one on March 14th. A few at Isle of May on March
15th; none there on April 3rd: fair S.E. breeze. In autumn
full records, but not before Sept. 11th, at Sumburgh Head,
accompanied by "Rock Larks." Occurred at Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest as above, Sept.
11th; latest Dec. 31. Rush from about Sept. 11th to 18th at
Sumburgh Head, and also patent at Isle of May; vast rush most
observed at Bell Rock and Isle of May in October (see under
<a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>). At Bell Rock most on Oct. 12th, "Bullfinches,
Blackbirds, Mavises, Larks, Stonechats, Golden-crested Wrens,
Titlarks and Starlings, dead on balcony or fell into sea. Mr.
Jack is sure hundreds must have been killed that night."
Again, on Dec. 20th, Mr. Jack remarks, "largest numbers
of Larks ever seen here; impossible to state numbers seen or
killed; striking hard for hours, like a shower of hail." On Oct.
12th and Dec. 20th loss of life must have been very great;
great flocks of Larks alone at Bell Rock on 16th and again on
31st. Records do not take me beyond this date. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Records of Common Starling comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
scanty. Earliest July 1st at Isle of May, a large flock of young
birds and daily flocks seen, mostly young, to July 29th. On
Aug. 7th a large flock seen coming from the N.; another on
14th. Numbers on Island fall off in September; by the 23rd
but few left. In October only one record at Pentland Skerries,
when two struck; none in November, and two records in December,
on 17th at Pentland Skerries, and on 25th at Isle of May,
when eight were seen. Scarcity of Starlings again (see Report
1881, p. 9) noticeable. One species. The only other British
species is a very rare British bird&mdash;the Rose-coloured Starling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;I have records from every month in the year but
June. I take them in order. In January one record, a large
flock of Jackdaws seen flying S.W. at Cromarty (probably a
local migration). At Isle of May one Rook on Feb. 12th, flying
W., wind S.W. In March, at Sumburgh Head, two Ravens
("the first seen since the autumn of 1881" here), flying N. with
light S. breeze, and another seen on the 16th in a W. gale. At
Isle of May two Rooks seen on 29th ("never many seen here
together"), light W. breeze. In April, at Bell Rock, four Rooks
seen flying E. over the sea, wind S.E., April 4th; at Isle
of May, on May 14th, four Carrion Crows and thirty-six Hooded
Crows alighted and killed several of Mr. Agnew's lambs; N.E.
gale at the time. At Pentland Skerries two Rooks on Island,
wind fair, S.S.E. In autumn, records from most of the stations
sending returns, from July 26th, at Pentland Skerries, to Dec.
9th, at same place (Ravens). The only, appearance of a rush
was when fifteen Hooded Crows appeared at Pentland Skerries,
but this may only have been local. This was on Oct. 12th,
however, the time of the vast rush of other species. The
Pentland Skerries are regularly visited by Ravens and Hooded
Crows, and occasionally by Rooks, which latter may come across
the North Sea at times, or may simply make local migrations
from Tongue in Sutherlandshire. A few appeared at the Isle of
May also at the time of the vast rush. Five species of <i>Corvid&aelig;</i>
noted. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Mr. Garrioch writes:&mdash;"I obtained a male
Jackdaw on Oct. 15th, shot on a peat dyke near Lerwick. Same
evening a large flock of Ravens assembled on the shore at
Sound (?), attracted by a number of Puffins' and Guillemots'
bodies driven ashore by the force of the sea, as also fish of
different sorts which had shared the same fate. The Ravens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">-17-</span>
betook themselves to the high cliffs of Bressay. They continued
to pass the same spot during November, December and January,
going westward over the islands every morning at daybreak and
returning at dusk to roost in the same rocks." On Oct. 14th a
Crow took refuge on a vessel&mdash;the Danish ship 'Otto' (Capt.
Mortensen)&mdash;about eleven miles from St. Abb's Head, and flew
off shoreward on approaching Granton ('Edinburgh Courant,'
Oct. 14th).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypselid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;One record only at Sumburgh Head, on Aug.
23rd; light airs N., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuculid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;We had no entries under this head anywhere on
east coast of Scotland in 1881. At Cromarty, Cuckoo first heard,
April 4th, light E. breeze, clear; and on June 23rd two Cuckoos
were all day on Isle of May, both of which Mr. Agnew secured
for the Isle of May collection, and they were old and young.
Stated by Mr. Agnew to be very rare on Isle of May. One
species. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;A Cuckoo was shot on Aug. 30th, at
Glasslaw, Bruchlay, Aberdeenshire (<i>vide</i> W. Horn).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strigid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Earliest July 4th, at Pentland Skerries, one
"Horned Owl" (rare). In Sept., at Auskerry, two Short-eared
Owls seen at noon, light variable wind; and in October a pair
remained at same place three days after 28th. One seen at
Pentland Skerries on 12th. Fresh E.S.E. breeze. On Nov. 18th,
at Bell Rock, one Long-eared Owl rested on balcony, fresh S.
breeze; and on 9th one Short-eared Owl seen asleep in grass on
Isle of May, and afterwards shot for Isle of May collection. On
Dec. 19th, at Pentland Skerries, one Grey Owl. Probably only
two species, but possibly three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Falconid&aelig;</span> occur in almost every month of the year, but
fewer records in spring than in autumn. Many visits are the
result of only local migration in search of food; indeed such
are the great majority of instances, although these must also come
to be distinguished as far as possible from the birds of actual
passage. In spring, frequent in February at several stations,
always on predatory excursions, notably at insular stations, as
Whalsey and Isle of May. In March only two records at some
places, and in April two at the same places, both on the same day&mdash;the
23rd. At Whalsey a game Hawk rested, apparently much
fatigued, wind E. and haze. In May one record on 25th, at Isle
of May. In autumn, at Whalsey, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
Bressay, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, Isle of May. Records
numerous, though not so great as in 1881. Greatest aggregate
in any one month in October. Most numerous at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest July 29th, at Isle of May,
one small Hawk. Latest through December into Jan., 1883.
Rush, if any can be said to be appreciable, in October. Thus,
such species as game Hawks, large Hawks, large brown Hawks,
dark grey Hawks, &amp;c., appear in the records more abundantly in
October than at other times, whilst Sparrowhawks, Merlin and
Kestrel appear more frequently at other times. The following
species are included, but it would be more satisfactory to obtain
specimens:&mdash;Kestrel, Merlin, Sparrowhawk (max.), and those
mentioned above. On Oct. 12th two Hawks were hunting small
birds all night, in the zone of light. Buzzards and Harriers
are also probably included.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Difficult to say how many species are intended, but probably at least six.</p>

<p class="caption3nb">WATER-BIRDS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, in May, at Sumburgh Head, ten
Gannets were seen, flying S., at 9.30 a.m., with S.S.E. breeze,
and on 4th thirty-five, also flying S., with S.E. breeze. In
autumn, at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries and Dunnet
Head, observations taken; earliest July 5th, three flying S.E.,
mod. N.W. at Sumburgh. On 17th, flying E. all day, fresh S.
showers. Pass and repass Dunnet Head every day till Sept. 15th
in threes and dozens. One species. <i>Other Notes.</i>&mdash;From Mr. T.
Anderson, S.S. 'Marathon,' Dec. 27th, 1882.&mdash;"This has not
been a very good trip for observations oh birds, the southerly
migration being past; but when off the coast of Portugal, on our
way home, I saw from 150 to 200 Solan Geese in company, and
occasionally finding a shoal of fish. All their movements were
in a northerly direction; when they were done with a shoal
01 fish, they never proceeded S., but always N."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Common Herons: Stragglers at almost all times;
most records in autumn. That local migration is principally
indicated is seen by the very various directions of flight noted at
some stations, often coming from and returning to the same
points of the compass. These are given in detail in sixteen
schedules and in the ledger from which this report is written.
In spring, April 11th, record at Isle of May, one at Sumburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
Head, marked "rare," light S.E. airs; and Herons frequented
the shore off and on at Isle of May, from the date of May 1st to
the first week in September. On 24th three were seen; these
flying N. On June 19th one addition was seen there. In July
two recorded, one flying N. on 31st. In autumn, Aug. 16th, at
Sumburgh Head, one flying W., light E. airs; on 17th three
flying N., light S.E. airs; and on 19th one flying W., light E.
airs. In Sept., at Whalsey, on 14th, one flying W., marked "very
rare so early," wind N., fresh, and at Cromarty "seen daily since
first week in May." At Isle of May on 22nd, in calm and haze,
one "screaming as if lost." Then in October we find on different
dates Herons recorded as flying in all directions: 13th, "came
from S. and returned S.;" 23rd, flying W., wind S.W.; flying
S.W., gale S.E., all night at Bressay, when many other species
struck unseen; 24th, at Isle of May, flying S., and similar records
at various stations all through November. N.B. These ledger
entries may be useful later. One species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wild Geese: In spring, on March 1st, two were
seen, flying very fast, 1000 feet in the air, crying loudly, before an
E.S.E wind, and settled on the land at Sumburgh Head to rest.
A Brent Goose seen at Isle of May on March 20th, and a large
flock of Geese flying E. accompanied by Curlews at Isle of May,
on April 21st. One Brent ("Sly Goose") at Pentland Skerries,
in June (marked "rare"), flying E. In autumn, at Chanonry,
Sumburgh Head, North Ronaldshay and Isle of May. Earliest
noted, but probably local movement after the birds had taken up
their quarters on Aug. 26th, at Chanonry, when 100 Grey Geese
were seen, fair S.W., clear. Here the general flight is N. or S.,
being the "lie" of the Firth; on 28th also 100 seen. Latest
records into January, 1883. Bushes imperceptible, but very
large flocks are mentioned at Isle of May, on December 23rd
and 24th, flying from S.W. to N.E. "Sly Geese" (Brent) are
noted on Oct. 14th, at Sumburgh Head; at Isle of May, thirteen
Wild Geese, flying W. in a single line, on Oct. 2nd, light S. wind,
clear. Two species of Wild Goose. Eider Duck arrived at
breeding haunts at Whalsey Head on March 29th; wind N. and
haze. At Isle of May twenty-three, about equal male and
female, first seen on March 1st, after a gale which had lasted for
twenty-four hours from E. to S.E., and which brought over
Redwings, Lapwings, Rooks, Hoodies, &amp;c. (see <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a>). First
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
record at Sumburgh Head is not till April 17th; three seen;
fresh E.N.E. wind. In autumn, at Pentland Skerries, continuous
flocks flying S.E., mostly females, on Oct. 6th (compare with
Report 1881, p. 12). Again, at Sumburgh Head, three (the first
seen), on Nov. 5th, fresh W.; and at Pentland Skerries, on 22nd,
a flock, mixed male and female, flying S.; and on 28th a large
flock, mostly males, about the rocks all day. Of other Ducks
scattered records only: a few Teal, seen on March 1st, at Isle
of May; at Pentland Skerries, Sept. 3rd; and seven on pools on
Island, on Dec. 6th. Grey Ducks (probably Scaup or Pochard)
at Chanonry, where some 400 flying W. were noted. The
records of <span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;</span> not so voluminous this season as last;
three or four species. On March 23rd fifteen White Swans came
from S., rested on the sea at Sumburgh Head, and flew on N.;
wind fresh, S.W. breeze. Again at same place. Swans flying N.
and crying loudly on April 10th. On May 9th one was shot at
same place. It alighted in a v&ouml;e three miles from station, and
was no doubt a weakly bird so late in the spring; fresh S.S.E.
In autumn, records at Sumburgh Head, N. Ronaldshay, Chanonry,
and Isle of May. Earliest Sept. 18th, at Chanonry, when
six were seen; light S.W. and cloudy. At same place, two on
25th and ten on 26th; haze and rain, variable and light N.E.
In November, six flying W. at N. Ronaldshay, strong N.E. and
snow. In December four seen at N. Ronaldshay, fresh E., and
on 28th two seen at N. end of Isle of May. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Look out
always for two sizes of Wild Swan&mdash;the large Common Wild
Swan and the lesser Bewick's Swan. If together the two species
are easily distinguishable. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Brent Geese unusually
abundant on the Tay this year, 1881-82 (P. D. Maloch).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Note.</i>&mdash;We had no records of Pigeons on E.
coast last season, 1881. This year we have them both in spring
and autumn. We would like to know if all records of "Wood
Pigeon" are strictly correct, and if no veritable Stock Doves
passed on migration.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In spring, at Bell Rock, on April 9th, one
"Wood Pigeon" struck and was killed at 10.30 p.m., light
S.S.E.; and at Isle of May one struck and was killed at 2 a.m.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span>
light S.E. Again, on May 22nd, one seen at Isle of May, S.E.
clear; and on 29th one, at 6 p.m., seen flying S., light W., clear;
and on June 28th one again, at Isle of May, at 3 p.m., light E.,
fog. In autumn, on Sept. 26th, at Isle of May, one, light S.E.,
hail and rain; and Nov. 2nd, at Isle of May, one flew S., after
coming to the light; and on 26th another was seen. At Pentland
Skerries one rose off the island and flew W., gale from S.E.
In December, Wood Pigeons occurred at Isle of May under the
following circumstances and dates:&mdash;On 3rd, one; on 6th,
thirteen flying S., severe snow-storm; on 12th, thirty, light W.
wind, thick fog; on 13th, fifty-one in lighthouse garden, eating
ravenously; severe snow-storm from the 6th to 9th, and hard
frost until 16th; on 14th-15th, hundreds seen. A rush caused
by local stress of weather, or they may have come directly across
seas. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;I have elsewhere noted the arrivals of Wood
Pigeons from Norway, as seen by me on the Fifeshire coast, and
the S. trend of their flight, as soon as they came over the land;
and I have given the above records in detail, as I think they will
be useful again.) Besides Wood Pigeons, I have two records of
Rock Doves,&mdash;one at Pentland Skerries, seen flying N., with
light S. wind, at 3 p.m., on Nov. 8th; and one on Dec. 1st, at
midnight, at Dunnet Head, fresh S.S.E., thick haze and rain;
probably only local movements. Two species recorded. <i>Land
Notes.</i>&mdash;About a dozen "Small Pigeons," which "may," Mr.
Garrioch thinks, "have been Wood Pigeons," were seen in the
Island of Yell at the end of October, and from other quarters.
Mr. Garrioch was informed of flights of "strange birds seen from
the off-lying islands flying off in a southerly direction."</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> See a paper by me on the "Increase and Extension of Range of the
Stock Dove," read before the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, Feb.,
1883. They are seen in large migratory flocks on the mainland in May&mdash;as
in the Carse of Gowrie&mdash;in some seasons, and I have received specimens this
spring and winter from two localities in this county&mdash;Stirlingshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rallid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Records of Corn Crake scarce. In May, first
heard at Cromarty on 14th. In September one killed at light at
Pentland Skerries on 20th, light N.E. and cloudy, indicating
possibly date of departure from the Orkneys. <i>Land Note.</i>&mdash;I am
credibly informed that the Corn Crake was heard in two different
localities in N. Uist about March 18th, 1882; Mr. Alex. Carmichael,
who is studying the Natural History of the Long Island,
himself heard one. Very late occurrences of this species are
also on record in previous years, such as at Tyree on Nov. 24th,
1880, evidently wounded or disabled birds (W. Craibe Angus,
who exhibited the bird at a late meeting of the Glasg. Nat. Hist.
Soc.); and another, dating Dec. 17th, 1882, is recorded from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span>
Ireland in 'The Zoologist,' April, 1883, p. 177. It seems quite
probable that some birds detained from migrating may remain
all winter in the milder portions of Great Britain, and that early
spring records may thus, in many cases, be accounted for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriad&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Golden Plover: in spring, one record at
Sumburgh Head; three seen, light S. breeze and cloudy, at
10.30 a.m. In autumn, at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries,
Dunnet Head, Isle of May. Smaller movement in 1882 than in
1881. Earliest recorded, Aug. 7th, at Pentland Skerries; a
flock. Latest, at same place, on Dec. 18th; a single bird.
Rushes scarcely appreciable, except 120 birds on Oct. 15th, at
Sumburgh Head; S.S.E. gale and rain; and a large flock (?) at
Dunnet Head on Oct. 2nd. At Sumburgh Head also about forty
on Nov. 12th. Oystercatcher: in spring "Sea-pyots" arrived
here, Whalsey, on March 3rd at night, with strong E.S.E. breeze
and clear. Two seen, first time, at Isle of May on April 2nd. In
autumn, after remaining on Whalsey, left between Aug. 13th and
18th, during a fog and fresh S.E. breeze; and on 13th, at Isle
of May, one large flock of young were seen, light S. and haze.
On Sept. 14th a flock flew about Pentland Skerries all day in
light N. breeze. Beyond these I have no other records. Of
Lapwing, a record or two on Feb. 13th and 24th, after S.W. gale
on 13th; and 26th, stragglers? In spring, at Whalsey ("very
rare"), Sumburgh Head, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest
in spring, March 2nd, at Isle of May, after a gale from E. to S.E.
for twenty-four hours (see under <a href="#Turdidae"><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;</span></a> of date); 3rd, eight
seen; large numbers again on 20th. Latest on June 19th, four,
with light S.E. and haze. Two only in May at Isle of May, and
these appeared with light N.E. wind. In April a few passed on
3rd, 9th, and 10th, in easterly winds, or rested. In autumn, at
Pentland Skerries, Chanonry, and Isle of May. Earliest, Aug.
17th, one seen, light W. wind. Latest, a few in December, at
Pentland Skerries, flying W. Bushes inappreciable, unless
Sept. 14th, at Chanonry, forty seen; and on 28th, at Isle of May,
twenty-seven seen, in light S.S.E. wind. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;On
April 16th Lapwings were still going in flocks in the central
counties of Scotland. At the River Pattack, in S. Inverness-shire,
I saw distinctly a Whimbrel (<i>Numenius ph&aelig;opus</i>) twice, on
May 24th. (Possibly an addition to the birds of Inverness shire.)
See under W. coast also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">-23-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Curlew: in spring, a number of records at
Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, Isle of May.
Earliest, at Isle of May ("unusual at this season"), one seen,
light W. wind and clear. Latest, at Isle of May, a number seen
on June 28th, light E. fog. As early as May 23rd one young
one seen on rocks at Isle of May (this properly belongs to autumn
migration; result abnormal, perhaps owing to unusually early
season, after a mild winter). General movement continuing all
July, and difficult to separate spring and autumn man&#339;uvres.
As will be seen others of the <i>Scolopacid&aelig;</i> make early appearances
also this season (Woodcock, Snipe, &amp;c.). In autumn, a large
movement of Curlews between Pentland Skerries and Isle of
May. To the N. of Pentland Skerries very few observed.
Earliest (if we take July), July 10th, at Pentland Skerries, one
heard. Latest, also at Pentland Skerries, on Dec. 7th, a flock,
strong E. Rushes spasmodical and frequent in July and August.
<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Between Oct. 14th and 19th, strong S. gale, moderate on
20th, at Pentland Skerries. Sept. 22nd, October and December,
but almost inappreciable in numbers. Woodcock, a few in
spring, but a steady record in autumn. In spring, one record
at Isle of May on April 9th; "not remembered to have been seen
here before at this season." In autumn, at Whalsey, Sumburgh
Head, N. Ronaldshay, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May.
Earliest, Oct. 8th (N.B., commencement of vast migration before
noted), two seen at N. Ronaldshay, S.E. fresh; continued in
small numbers through 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 25th (co-existent
with rush of other species), at most stations on
E. coast sending returns. Latest, on Dec. 4th, at Pentland
Skerries. Evident rush on Oct. 13th at Isle of May, when no
less than twenty were shot there. On Isle of May a record in
November says, "very unusual so late," when three were seen.
Of Snipe, only one record at Isle of May in spring, on April 5th,
with the remark, "very unusual at this season." Autumn, at
Sumburgh Head and Whalsey (only two records), and at Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest, several on Aug. 17th,
at Pentland Skerries; and 6th, one at Isle of May, strong W.,
clear (remark, "very early"). Latest, on Dec. 19th, at Pentland
Skerries, six seen, strong S.W. Scarcely a rush appreciable.
Jack Snipes are recorded on Sept. 25th and 27th, at Isle of May,
with light S. and S.E. breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;</span> (Waders).&mdash;Earliest, "Plovers Pages" or
"Plovers Leaders" (Dunlin, J. A. H. B.), Aug. 10th, at Isle
of May; latest, Redshanks, Dec. 7th, at Isle of May. "Sandlarks"
and "Pipers" appeared at Chanonry, Aug. 30th, when
one was seen, and disappeared on Oct. 13th. (Probably the
Common Sandpiper, but "Pipers" is a name used generically
for many species.) If any rush, apparent on Sept. 19th, 20th,
and 26th, at Chanonry. Numbers on these dates: 90, 90, and
290; but this is deceptive, and not to be relied upon as a
statistic, Waders movements are so erratic. Returns of
"Pipers," "Waders," "Redshanks," and "Sandlarks," are
given from several stations. Probably seven or eight species of
Waders. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Rare occurrences. Pectoral Sandpiper
(<i>Tringa maculata</i>, Vieill.) shot at The Ross Priory, mouth of the
Endrick River, Loch Lomond, by Sir Geo. Leith Buchanan, Bart.,
on Nov. 24th, 1882. There seems to be a line of country across
this part of Scotland where rare things turn up, witness:&mdash;Desert
Chat, at Alloa; Blue-throated Warbler, Isle of May;
Great Grey Shrikes, commonly; and others. (See General
Remarks, <i>infra</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring. Terns arrived at breeding haunts at
Whalsey on May 19th, on island, all day long; came from S.E.,
with S.E. wind and clear; seen again on 28th (same date as
1881). At Sumburgh Head on June 2nd, and five on 6th. At
Cromarty, Lesser Tern arrived at 2 p.m. on June 11th, strong
N. and clear; and more on 15th. In autumn, Whalsey, Sumburgh
Head, Pentland Skerries, Cromarty, Isle of May. Earliest,
for two minutes or so heard passing over the lights at 10.30, at
Sumburgh Head, light E. airs and thin haze. On Aug. 15th all
left Whalsey, light S. breeze, haze and fog. "Leave Pentland
Skerries about Aug. 30th." Lesser Tern left Cromarty on Aug.
29th; three seen flying south at Sumburgh Head on Sept. 4th
(the only record in that month this year). One more record on
Nov. 26th at Pentland Skerries, a flock on island all day. Two
species. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Look out for the Sandwich Tern,&mdash;a large Tern,
much larger than the Common Tern; goes up the Fife and
Forfar coasts in spring.&mdash;J. A. H. B.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, "Chasers" (Skuas), one on May 28th,
at Portland Skerries ("rare here"), E.S.E. breeze. ("Picked
up limpets thrown at it by the men.") He speaks of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span>
as "Chasers," but in autumn of "Skuas or Norwegian Gulls,
very rare." Of Skuas there are four species known in Scotland,
<i>viz.</i>, the Great Skua, or Bonxie of Shetland; the Richardson's
Skua, or commonest species; the Long-tailed, or Buffon's Skua,
with very long centre tail-feathers; and the Pomatorhine Skua,
with curious recurved tail-feathers. Perhaps this note may be
of service in future in separating them. The Bonxie and the
Pomatorhine are rare. In autumn, Skua, or "Dirty Allan," at
Isle of May on Oct. 15th, one seen, and well described; and three
seen of "Skua," or "Norwegian Gull," at Pentland Skerries on
19th, and again on 29th. Kittiwakes are recorded, Aug. 5th, at
Isle of May; large numbers. <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Most of birds breeding on
Isle of May had left by this time, but a number of Kittiwakes
remain still; all left by 25th, however. Great Black-backed
Gulls noted passing S. past Isle of May on Aug. 13th. "Large
White Gulls" (glaucous?) often wheeling round, Aug. 25th, for
two or three days; and a large flight came from N., and flew S.
past Isle of May, on Oct. 24th. "Iceland Gulls" at Sumburgh
Head, on Dec. 1st and 8th, after gales and rain. Gulls,
enormous numbers (and Gannets) passed Isle of May, Sept. 30th.
Herring Gulls, a movement S. past Isle of May all day, on 10th.
Lesser Black-backed Gulls (called "Lady Ann Gulls ") flying
S.E., and numbers on the 14th and 18th. Iceland Gulls (with
Swans), two seen at Sumburgh Head, Dec. 25th, and one (last
record) on Dec. 8th. The Larger Glaucous Gull is not always
easily distinguished from the Lesser Iceland Gull; both being
very white, however, and are in relationship to one another as
the Great Black-backed Gull is to the Lesser Black-backed Gull.
Land Notes.&mdash;At Lerwick a large flock of Common Gulls passed
northward in the evening, flying very low, on Oct. 13th.&mdash;(J. T. G.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellariid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;One Stormy Petrel record; two seen at
noon at Auskerry on Sept. 29th; light variable breezes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In spring, records from Whalsey, Sumburgh Head,
and Isle of May. On Feb. 1st, large numbers of Razorbills and
Marrots appeared at Isle of May, light S. breeze; and again on
March 18th; and a great increase on May 3rd; light S.E.
Black Guillemots appeared at Whalsey during the night of
March 2nd, with light E.S.E. breeze, and clear (called "Tysties").
At Sumburgh Head, Guillemots (or "Marrots") arrived on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span>
March 18th, a fortnight later than in 1881. In autumn, a
general migration of Rock Birds, between Aug. 13th and 18th,
during a fog (Why do birds apparently often choose a fog to
depart in?), light S.E. (or is it always more to do with direction
of the wind at the time?). See back. At Pentland Skerries,
continuous streams of Guillemots flying E. through the N.
Pentland Firth. Little Auks, one in E. gale on Nov. 16th, close
to Isle of May, and more resting on 18th; and a few in a severe
snow-storm on Dec. 7th, at same place. Four species of <i>Alcid&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Of unknown birds I have left out notices this year, though
keeping note of them for further use, as they may come to be
identified later.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Printed</span> forms of enquiry and letters of instruction were sent
to thirty-six lighthouses and light-vessels on the East Coast of
England, and two stations on the Channel Islands,&mdash;thirty-eight
altogether, against thirty-six in 1881,&mdash;and returns have been
received from thirty, a result which is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Independent reports have also been sent in from Heligoland,
Seaton-Carew, and Redcar, Flamborough, Spurn, North-East
Lincolnshire, and Northrepps, making a total of thirty-seven
reporting stations, against thirty-two in 1881.</p>

<p>I have again to thank H. G&auml;tke, T. H. Nelson, C. Donald
Thompson, Matthew Bailey, William Eagle Clarke, H. Bendelack
Hewetson, M.D., and J. H. Gurney, jun., for their general kind
co-operation and assistance in the enquiry.</p>

<p>Special thanks are also given to all my kind and painstaking
observers on the lighthouses and light-vessels whose names are
given in the report. While thanks are due to all, it may perhaps
be not invidious to mention the very excellent returns received
from the Farne Island stations, the Longstone and Inner Farne
lighthouses, no less than eleven well-filled schedules having been
sent in.</p>

<p>The east coast stations are as follows, those making returns

many; 23rd, same; and on 29th, some. Autumn: Heligoland,
Sept. 17th, E.-N.E., calm, some; and at intervals to Nov. 7th,

a fine adult male shot.</p>

<p>Whinchat, <i>Pratincola rubetra</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Great Cotes, August,
last week, some number of young birds. Spurn, Oct. 15th, all day.
Heligoland, from Aug. 6th, young birds, and throughout month.</p>

<p>Stonechat, <i>P. rubicola</i>,&mdash;Spring: Heligoland, Feb. 27th, 1882,
two or three; 28th, several; March 1st, one fine old male.
Autumn: Great Cotes, first week in September, many young;
October and November, old birds, sparingly.</p>

<p>Redstart, <i>Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Spring: Inner Farne
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, April 22nd and 23rd, some with Wheatears. Autumn:
Spurn, Sept. 7th, one. Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 14th, N.E., 5 p.m., on
rocks. Yarmouth, 22nd, a few; and from Oct. 7th to 13th a few
from the Farne Islands southward to Spurn. Have been comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">-31-</span>
scarce compared with the large numbers which accompanied
the Wheatears on their southward migration up the coast
in the autumns of 1880 and 1881. Across Heligoland from Aug.
10th to first week in October; on the 5th, great many, with
Wheatears, wind E., fresh.</p>

<p>Blackstart, <i>R. titys</i> (Scop.).&mdash;Heligoland, March 13th to
14th, one; 17th, eight to ten; and to April 8th, daily, some.
Autumn: Spurn, Oct. 29th, one, adult female; stomach contained
remains of Coleoptera, entire ants, and two large seeds.
Migrates earlier in the spring and later in the autumn than the
Redstart.</p>

<p>Red-spotted Bluethroat, <i>Cyanecula suecica</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Heligoland,
Sept. 16th, E.N.E., in great numbers, with Redstarts, Goldcrests,
Wheatears, &amp;c.; 20th, S.E., fresh, many; 23rd, very
numerous. At Spurn, Sept. 11th, two immature, one obtained.
It appears yet to be an open question with ornithologists whether
the young of suecica are distinguishable from those of leucocyana
in the plumage of the first year; the Spurn bird therefore may
be an example of the Central European form, the White-spotted
Bluethroat.</p>

<p>Redbreast, <i>Erithacus rubecula</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Spring: Heligoland,
March 13th and 14th, several; April 8th, 22nd and 23rd, some.

and 19th; again on 27th and 28th. At Orfordness and Languard
Point lighthouses and Ship wash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on Sept. 20th, and from
Oct. 6th to 25th between the Longstone <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> and East Goodwin

13th at many stations and in large numbers. At the Galloper
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, on 6th, with Wrens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sylviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Whitethroat, <i>Sylvia cinerea</i> (Linn.), Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,

one killed. Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, June 17th, 9.50 p.m., 6 a.m., two and
a Wren killed. Autumn: Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, July 18th, 3 a.m., S.W.,
seven stunned. During September and first week in October at
several stations during night. Blackcap, <i>S. atricapilla</i> (Linn.),
Heligoland, April 23rd, some; 28th, many. Lesser Whitethroat,
<i>S. curruca</i> (Linn.), also some. Heligoland, in the autumn. Whitethroats
on Aug. 6th, and through September in great numbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span>
to Oct. 7th. Garden Warbler from Aug. 19th to end of September.
Blackcap as late as Oct. 27th.</p>

<p>Golden-crested Wren, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>, Koch.&mdash;Spring, 1882:
Heligoland, March 13th and 14th, several, and on to April 12th.
Autumn: the autumn of 1882 will be long remembered amongst
ornithologists from the extraordinary immigration of Goldcrests
on to the east coasts of Scotland and England. On the east coast
of England the migration extended over ninety-two days, commencing
Aug. 6th. Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, midnight, two stunned against
lantern, and a week later at Redcar, Aug. 13th, wind S.W., forty
to fifty, at 8 a.m., seen on the breakwater, and forward, at
many stations and in immense numbers, to Nov. 5th, Cockle
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 5 a.m., one caught against glass. They arrived somewhat
sparingly in August and through September, and day
after day in enormous numbers in October; in this month they
are recorded at twenty-one stations between the Farne Islands
and the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, off Guernsey. There appear to have been
two great rushes, one on the night of Oct. 7th and morning of
8th, and again on night of 12th and morning of 13th, the latter
with the Woodcock.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Many also are likewise reported during the
month to have alighted on fishing-boats, steam-vessels, &amp;c., in the
North Sea. At Heligoland, on Oct. 8th, all the island swarmed
with them; they had also been exceedingly numerous there from
Sept. 8th, continuing also to arrive and depart throughout
October, and on the night from 28th to 29th Mr. G&auml;tke remarks,
"a perfect storm of Goldcrests we have had,&mdash;poor little souls!&mdash;perching
on the ledges of the window-panes of the lantern of our
lighthouse, preening their feathers in the glare of the lamps; on
the 29th all the island swarmed with them, filling the gardens
everywhere, and over all the cliff&mdash;hundreds of thousands; by
9 a.m. most of them had passed on again." On English coast,
Farne Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Oct. 8th, "never remember seeing so many at
one time." Whitby <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 8th and 12th, "great rush." Flamborough,
7th to 14th, "never more seen." Spurn, 7th to 8th,
"in turnip-fields, hedges, and everywhere, never more seen."
Great Cotes, 8th, great many everywhere, and even on the piles
of timber on the dock-quays and timber-yards at Grimsby.
Dudgeon <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, 12th, "flock to W." Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, 10th and 12th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span>
latter night "large flocks," and at other stations, too numerous
to detail, in large numbers. General direction E. to W., and
E.S.E. to W.N.W., winds easterly over North Sea nights of 7th
and 12th, with fogs and drizzling rain on latter night. These
small wanderers reached the land in a very exhausted state, and
great numbers are supposed to have perished in mid-passage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> At this date the stream of Goldcrests extended quite across England,
the Irish Channel, and into Ireland.</p>

</div>

<p>It is curious that the Fire-crested Wren, <i>R. ignicapillus</i> (C. L.
Brehm), has not been observed at Heligoland during the autumn,
although generally it is tolerably numerous.</p>

<p>At the Newarp <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, in March and April, 1883, an immense migration
of various birds was observed almost day by day; amongst
those on April 14th three Golden-crested Wrens going eastward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring: East Yorkshire, Chiffchaff, <i>Phylloscopus
collybita</i> (Vieill.), March 13th. Willow Wren, P. trochilus
(Linn.), Heligoland, April 22nd and 23rd, some. Autumn: Spurn
and East Lincolnshire, first week in September, many; latest.
Spurn, Oct. 25th. Chiffchaff also at Spurn on 29th. Heligoland,
Willow Wren, Aug. 15th, some, and forward in great numbers to
Oct. 19th. Chiffchaff, Sept. 21st, and a great number at intervals
to Oct. 27th. Wood Wren, <i>P. sibilatrix</i> (Bechst.), Oct. 27th, one.
Yellow-browed Warbler, <i>P. superciliosus</i> (Gm.), Oct. 23rd, W., one;
27th, S.W., one seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring: Spurn, May 29th, 11 p.m., misty,
two Reed Warblers, <i>Acrocephalus streperus</i> (Vieill.), killed against
lantern; Spurn, Aug. 20th, midnight, three old males killed;
Great Cotes, Sept. 2nd, in bean-fields. On Sept. 12th, 1881, two
Grasshopper Warblers, <i>Locustella n&aelig;via</i> (Bodd.), were killed in the
night against the lantern of Spurn lighthouse (omitted in report
for 1881). Heligoland, Sept. 19th, one Grasshopper Warbler.</p>

<p>Hedgesparrow, <i>Accentor modularis</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Spring: Heligoland,
March 12th, some; 13th and 14th, some; 20th to April 12th,
daily some. Autumn: At Spurn and in East Lincolnshire great
numbers were observed during the first fortnight in September.
Spurn, Oct. 8th, most abundant, and on the Lincolnshire side,
same date, extraordinary numbers; in some localities, as stack-yards
and marsh hedgerows, swarming. Heligoland, Sept. 20th,
S.E., beginning to arrive; 22nd, great many; on Oct. 6th and
7th, marvellous numbers; also on 8th, and continuing to arrive
and pass forward in very great numbers up to the 29th. It will
be seen that their extraordinary abundance at Spurn and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">-34-</span>
East Lincolnshire on Oct. 8th corresponds with the immense
flight at Heligoland at the same period, Oct. 6th, 7th and 8th.
At Languard Point, on March 1st, 1883, a large flock was seen
at 12.30 p.m., going eastward.</p>

<p>Bearded Reedling, <i>Panurus biarmicus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;Heligoland,
Oct. 9th, S.S.E., later thick and hazy, one, a male.</p>

daybreak of 14th, with many other birds, Larks, Starlings,
Thrushes, and two Robins&mdash;altogether many thousands of birds;
160 of various species picked up on deck, and it is calculated one
thousand struck and went overboard.</p>

was last observed in North Lincolnshire on Sept. 25th. "Flycatchers"
are frequently mentioned as occurring round the
lanterns at night; it is, however, impossible to say what birds
are intended, as the term is used indiscriminately for many of
the small insect-eating birds.</p>

<p>Hawfinch, <i>Coccothraustes vulgaris</i>, Pall.&mdash;Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>,
Oct. 20th, S.S.W. [No. 5], two came on board and remained all
night, then in the morning left, flying S.E. to N.W. At Heligoland,
Mr. G&auml;tke says, "the Hawfinch here is a well-known
customer, never in any numbers, but every spring and fall some,
betraying itself forthwith by its peculiar call-note, so out of all
proportion with its colossal beak."</p>

<p>Common Sparrow, <i>Passer domesticus</i> (Linn.).&mdash;From Sept.

north of Humber in October, November, and December, to
January 2nd. Teesmouth, Dec. 1st, large flocks preceding the
heavy snow-storm on 5th. Heligoland, Oct. 24th, S.S.E., strong

18th, 1882, N.N.W., all night great many, all day thousands
upon thousands over island, all to E.; miles out at sea the same;
Feb. 8th and 9th, great numbers across island; 10th and 11th,
the same with Starlings, all to W.; 15th, S.W., rain, from early
morning and all day, thousands from the east. Starlings same,
all very high; 25th, S.S.W., early, calm and fine, "flights on
flights" to E. by N.; 28th, Woodlark, <i>A. arborea</i>, Linn., "a small
party, the first"; March 2nd, a flight. Spurn, March 27th,

Nov. 12th, and on Dec. 13th to 15th inclusive, in the latter case
up the coast from N. to S., as well as directly inland from sea.
Larks appear to have been tolerably equally distributed over the
whole coast-line, and as usual to have crossed the North Sea in
enormous numbers, far outnumbering any other species. At
Heligoland, in the autumn, they appear, from Mr. G&auml;tke's notes,
to have passed on Oct. 11th, "great many passing above fog,"
call-notes heard; and subsequently in large numbers to Nov. 21st.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">-39-</span></p>

<p>Shore Lark, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i> (Linn.)&mdash;Spring: Heligoland,
March 20th, eight to ten; April 8th, E. by N., great many flights
of twenty or over; 9th, same; 11th, very numerous; 14th,
flights of thirty to forty; and to 24th, some daily. Autumn:
Oct. 4th, great many; 6th, "some" (that means with us here,
say a hundred); and subsequently at intervals to 28th, when
they passed by thousands; Nov. 27th, many still passing over.
Spurn, Oct. 26th, flock of seven; November and December,
tolerably abundant; about eighty shot near Yarmouth in October,
the greater portion being male birds.</p>

8th, S.E., fresh, clear, "actually still more than yesterday, over
the sea north and south of the island, multitudes like a continual
stream&mdash;never seen such masses"; 15th, eight to ten. Mem.:
"Jays requiring strong, dry, clear east wind; Tits and <i>pratensis</i>
the same; Chaffinches want east wind strong, but overcast, and
cloudy sky." The great abundance of the Jay in our English
woodlands has been remarked upon from many districts during
the winter of 1882-83; more especially, however, south of a line
drawn from Flamborough Head to Portland Bill, Dorset.</p>

<p>Magpie, <i>Pica rustica</i> (Scop.).&mdash;Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March 24th,

birds in great haste, flying as a rule <i>very</i> high; enormous flocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span>
of Jackdaws seen but as the finest dust; of many birds only
heard call-notes without being able to see them; wind S., S.E.,
and E. by S.</p>

<p>Carrion Crow, <i>C. corone</i>, Linn.&mdash;First at Orfordness <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>,
Sept. 23rd, seven to N.E.; and at several stations from Farne
Inner <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> to Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, in October, November, and December;
sometimes with Hooded Crows, occasionally in separate flocks.
On Oct. 9th, at Spurn, Mr. Hewetson shot a Crow from a flock
passing inland, which had a few white feathers under the chin and
some of the claws white. Heligoland, Oct. 27th, a small flight.</p>

<p>Hooded Crow, <i>C. cornix</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring: Spurn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, March

October and November at stations from Farne Islands to Goodwin
light-vessels; great rush Oct. 11th and 13th. Nothing
special to note of migration across Heligoland in the autumn,
which as usual was in immense numbers in October and
November. As a rule, few Hooded Crows cross south of Languard
Point, and few Carrion Crows north of Spurn. Rooks and
Jackdaws sparingly north of Spurn, and gradually increase
southward; and most plentiful at southern stations.</p>

<p>Rook, <i>C. frugilegus</i>, Linn.&mdash;Spring: Heligoland. Feb. 22nd,

Humber, and moving in the afternoon to the high wolds, where
at dusk they retire to the great woods to roost.</p>

<p>At the Inner Farne <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Aug. 19th, "a very large Swift,
supposed to be a foreigner, flying about island." About the end
of July an Alpine Swift, <i>C. melba</i>, Linn., was shot by Mr. Wm.
Rogerson, of Newcastle, at Alnmouth, Northumberland, and
recorded at the time in the 'Newcastle Journal,' Aug. 2nd, 1882,
as 9&frac14; inches in length, and 21 inches between the tips of the

<p>The Committee are indebted to Professor Chr. Fr. L&uuml;tken, of
the Universitetets Zoologiske Museum, Copenhagen, for a list of
the birds killed against the lantern of the lighthouse of Stevns,
on the projecting part of Zealand, marking the limit between
the Baltic and the Gr&ouml;nsund Belt, in the autumn of 1882.
Professor L&uuml;tken, in forwarding the list, remarked that his late
lamented predecessor. Professor Reinhardt, made arrangements
with a physician, Mr. Antander, residing at the small town
of Storeheddinge, seven Danish miles south of Copenhagen, in
the neighbourhood of Stevns Klint and the lighthouse of Stevns,
for forwarding any birds found killed to the museum, with the
following result:&mdash;</p>

<p>* Is often seen swarming around the lighthouse at the time of its
migration&mdash;six or seven on this night flew against the panes without being

<p>Mr. G&auml;tke sends the following notes of an extraordinary
migration of the Silver Gamma Moth, <i>Plusia gamma</i>, across
Heligoland in August, 1882:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Aug. 13th, at 1 a.m. till 4, thousands on thousands
passed the Heligoland lighthouse, travelling E. to W. From 11
p.m. on the 15th, till 3 a.m. on 16th, millions, like a snow-storm,
all belonging to the same species, passed forward in the same
direction. Again, on the 18th, from 11 p.m. till 3 a.m. on the
19th, thousands on thousands were observed under the same
circumstances. Some scores caught for identification were all
in most perfect plumage; no fading or abrasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">-48-</span></p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>The observations taken along the E. coast of England in the
spring and autumn of 1882 have been such as to confirm the
conclusions arrived at in previous reports.</p>

<p>As in 1880 and 1881, the line of autumn migration has been
a broad stream from E. to W., or from points S. of E. to N. of
W., covering the whole of the E. coast. In 1880 a considerable
proportion of the immigrants crossed at the more southern
stations; in 1881 they covered the whole of the E. coast in
tolerably equal proportions; but in 1882 the stations N. of the
Humber show a marked preponderance of arrivals.</p>

<p>Although migration has extended over an unusually long
period, commencing in July and continued with but slight intermission
throughout the autumn and into the following year to
the end of January, yet the great mass of immigrants arrived on
our E. coast in October, and a large proportion of these during
the first fortnight in the month. From Oct. 6th to 8th, inclusive,
and again from the 12th to the 15th there was, night and day,
an enormous rush, under circumstances of wind and weather,
which observation has shown are most opposed to a favourable
passage. During these periods birds arrived in an exhausted
condition, and we have reasons for supposing, from the number
reported as alighting on fishing-boats and vessels in the North
Sea, that the loss must have been very considerable; large
flights also are recorded as having appeared round the lanterns
of lighthouses and light-vessels during the night migration.
From the 6th to the 9th, inclusive, strong E. winds blew over
the North Sea, with fog and drizzling rain, and from the night
of the 12 to 17th very similar weather prevailed. Mr. W. Littlewood,
of the Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, moored on the bank of that name
forty miles S.E. of Orfordness, reports that on the night of Oct.
6th, Larks, Starlings, Mountain Sparrows, Titmice, Common
Wrens, Redbreasts, Chaffinches and Plover were picked up on
the deck, and that it is calculated five to six hundred struck the
rigging and fell overboard; a large proportion of these were
Larks. Thousands of birds were flying round the lantern from
11.30 p.m. to 4.45 a.m., their white breasts, as they dashed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">-49-</span>
and fro in the circle of light, having the appearance of a heavy
fall of snow. This was repeated on the 8th and 12th, and on
the night of the 13th 160 were picked up on deck, including
Larks, Starlings, Thrushes and two Redbreasts; it was thought
one thousand struck and went overboard into the sea. It is
only on dark rainy nights, snow or fog, that these casualties
occur; when the nights are light, or any stars visible, the birds
appear to give the lanterns a wide berth.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the principal feature of the autumn migrations
has been the enormous arrival of the little Gold-crested
Wren. The migrations appear to have covered not only the E.
coast of England, but to have extended southward to the Channel
Islands and northward to the Faroes (see <a href="#EAST_COAST_OF_SCOTLAND">Report East Coast of
Scotland</a>, Harvie Brown). On the E. coast of England they are
recorded at no less than twenty-one stations, from the Farne
Islands to the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey. The earliest notice is
Aug. 6th, the latest Nov. 5th, or ninety-two days; during the
same period enormous numbers crossed Heligoland, more
especially in October, and quite up to the end of the month. On
the night from the 28th to 29th Mr. G&auml;tke remarks, "We have
had a perfect storm of Goldcrests, poor little souls, perching on the
ledges of the window-panes of the lighthouse, preening their feathers
in the glare of the lamps. On the 29th all the island swarmed
with them, filling the gardens and over all the cliff,&mdash;hundreds
of thousands; by 9 a.m. most of them had passed on again."</p>

<p>Not less remarkable was the great flight of the Common Jay
past and over that island early in October, on the 6th, 7th, and
8th; thousands on thousands without interruption passing on
overhead like Crows, N. and S. of the island too, multitudes
like a continual stream, all going E. to W. in a strong south-easterly
gale. It would have been an interesting fact if we had
been able to correlate this migration of Jays with any visible
arrival on our English coast, but in none of our returns is any
mention made of the Jay. Mr. Matthew Bailey, of Flamborough,
told me that on one evening early in October (the exact date he
was not able to give) he had observed at dusk large flights of
birds, about the size of Jackdaws, coming to land, and was
struck with the good headway they seemed to make against a
strong wind. It was too dark, however, to make out what they
were. Subsequently I have received numerous notices speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span>
of the extraordinary number of Jays seen during the winter in
our English woodlands. This seems especially to have been the
case south of a line drawn from Flamborough Head to Portland
Bill, in Dorset.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Common Jay. Additions and unusual numbers observed at Arden, on
Loch Lomond side, subsequently reported by James Lumsden, Esq., is the
only report of Jays I have got in Scotland.&mdash;J. A. H. B.</p>

</div>

<p>Extraordinary numbers of the Common Hedge Sparrow
(<i>Accentor modularis</i>)&mdash;"the dunnock" of the English schoolboy,
the "blue Janet" of Scotland&mdash;passed over Heligoland in October,
more especially on the 6th, 7th, and 8th; and it is curious that
on the 8th of the same month they swarmed in astonishing
numbers, both at Spurn and in N.E. Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>The Woodcock arrived on the east coast on the night of
Oct. 12th, or early morning of the 13th; wind E., strong, fog,
and drizzling rain. On the morning of the 13th they are recorded
from nine stations, covering 250 miles of coast-line, from the
Farne Islands to Orfordness.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is fair to suppose that this, the
"great flight" of the season, did not start from the same locality,
but from various parts of the opposite coast of Europe,&mdash;places
widely apart. Both previous and subsequent to their passage the
weather had been much of the same character over the North
Sea. Why they should start simultaneously on this special
evening, and how they managed to "keep touch," to use a
military term, during a passage of several hundred miles across
a stormy sea, in fog and drizzling rain, so as to arrive about the
same time at their Tel-el-Kebir on our English sand-hills, is one
of those points in the phenomena of migration which will
probably take some time and more extended observations,
especially on the opposite coast-line, to clear up.</p>

</div>

<p>An interesting entry in one of the returned schedules, that
from the Inner Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, placed seventeen miles E. of
Sutton, on the Lincolnshire coast, is that of two Hawfinches,
which came on board on the evening of Oct. 20th, a strong
S.S.W. wind blowing, and remaining all night, left again at
daybreak, their course being from S.E. to N.W., the course
followed by a large proportion of our immigrants. As far as we
are aware this is the first notice of Hawfinches having been seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">-51-</span>
at sea. At Heligoland, Mr. G&auml;tke says the species is a well-known
customer, never in any numbers, but every spring and fall some,
betraying itself forthwith by its peculiar call-note, so out of all
proportion with its colossal beak.</p>

<p>There are some birds occurring on our east coast year by
year with tolerable regularity, which, during the autumn of 1882,
have been remarkable for their scarcity. This has been the case
with all the large raptorial birds, and especially with the Short-eared
Owl, and Common Linnet and Twite. Their absence on
migration has also been remarked upon in Heligoland. The
Short-eared Owl also appears to have been specially scarce
on the east coast of Scotland. (See East Coast of Scotland
Report.)</p>

<p>Our returns show very clearly that the spring lines of
migration, followed by birds leaving our shores, are identically
the same as those followed in the autumn, but of course in the
reverse direction from W. and N.W. to E. and S.E.</p>

<p>As this is the fourth report issued by the Committee, we
may, perhaps, with the mass of facts at our disposal, be expected
to draw deductions, which, if they do not explain, will serve
at least to throw some light on the causes influencing the
migration of birds. We might reasonably reply that the work
undertaken by us was not to theorise, or attempt explanations,
but simply to collect facts and tabulate them. This we have
endeavoured to do in the shortest and simplest manner consistent
with accuracy of detail. There is, however, one circumstance
which can scarcely fail to present itself to those who have gone
carefully into the reports issued by the Committee, namely, the
marvellous persistency with which, year by year, birds follow the
same lines of migration when approaching or leaving our shores:
the constancy of these periodical phenomena is suggestive of
some settled principle or law governing the movement. It is
clearly evident, from the facts already at our disposal, that there
are two distinct migrations going forward at the same time;
one, the ordinary flow in the spring and ebb in the autumn,
across the whole of the western Pal&aelig;arctic regions, which of
course includes the British Isles, of a great migratory wave
moving to and from the nesting-quarters of the birds in the
coldest part of their range, N.E. in the spring and S.W. in the
autumn. Quite independent of this there is a continual stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">-52-</span>
of immigrants, week by week and month by month, to the
eastern shores of these islands, coming directly across Europe
from E. to W., or more commonly from points S. of E. to others
N. of W., and the reverse in the spring. These are mainly
composed of those common and well-known species which
annually make these islands their winter resort, and take the
place of our summer birds: they come in one broad stream,
cutting the line of ordinary migration at nearly right angles;
one flank brushes the Orkneys and Shetlands, pouring through
the Pentland Firth, even touching the distant Faroes; the
southern wing crosses the Channel Islands, shaping its course
in a north-westerly direction to the English coast. In our
explanation of the causes which first induced, and perhaps still
influences, this E. to W. migration, we must probably go back a
long way in the history of the world, when the distribution of the
land and water of continental Europe was very different to what
it now is; when there was no North Sea, and the western coast-line
of Europe was represented by what is now known as the
hundred-fathom line off' the West of Ireland, a coast which on
the one side touched Scandinavia, and on the other was linked
with the Spanish peninsula. Great as is now the contrast
between the winters of Central Russia and those of these
islands, the difference would then be much more marked,&mdash;arctic
cold on one hand, and semi-tropical warmth on the
other.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It requires then no stretch of imagination to believe
that great flights of birds would on the approach of winter be
driven before the intense cold of Eastern and Central Europe to
seek refuge and find food in the warm regions of the west,
regions which then would feel the full effects of the warm
equatorial currents, and enjoy an almost perpetual summer.
This movement once begun would, by the very necessities of
existence, and in time by an hereditary instinct, be continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">-53-</span>
Gradually the land now occupied by the North Sea has been
withdrawn from beneath the migrating flocks; year after year
the middle passage became wider and more difficult; yet the
habit once formed would be continued, and hereditary instinct,
or whatever other name we choose to give it, supply the
rest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> There are ninety species of plants, all told, common alike to Southwestern
England and Ireland, and to the Pyrenean and Italian region.
They represent an old flora no longer adapted to the country,&mdash;a flora of
warmth and sunshine,&mdash;and now dying out under the advance of hardier,
more vigorous and congenial species. They may be regarded as the last
floral relics of the submerged land, that semi-tropical western land whose
plants and flowers are not of Scandinavian origin, but derived from Southern
Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wallace has told us how, in the Eastern Archipelago,
comparatively narrow, and probably very ancient, straits of
water divide and wholly separate distinct races of birds; and we
have instances of this in Europe, where species, common on the
opposite coast of the Continent, rarely or never occur in the
British Islands.</p>

<p>Small birds, like the Goldcrest, do not cross great breadths
of water from choice; they doubtless would prefer a migration
over land, from field to field, or hedge to hedge; or at the most
closely following some old established coast-line. Why, except
on some such hypothesis as stated, should they attempt the
North Sea, not alone at the narrowest part, the straits of Dover,
or from Ostend to the coast of Kent, but in the very widest
parts also, from the Elbe to the Humber, or Danish coast to the
Pentland Firth and Scotch islands? What impels our autumn
visitants, the young weeks in advance of their parents, to launch
westward across what, for anything they can possibly know to
the contrary, may prove an Atlantic, an ocean without a further
shore?</p>

<p>There are doubtless several causes, working separately or
together, which influence migration, and we must not look for
an explanation of the phenomena attending these great periodical
movements to one cause only, for by doing this we lose sight
perhaps of other equally powerful incentives. I have spoken in
previous reports of the probability of birds following ancient
coast-lines once linking now distant lands, impelled by what we
call, for want of a better term, hereditary instinct, that is, an
instinct derived through ancestors. It is, perhaps, an open
question whether the young, which undoubtedly arrive in the
autumn weeks in advance of the great mass of old birds, depend
entirely on this, or whether they are in any way dependent on
guidance and direction. It is a curious fact, which we have
frequently remarked, that the very earliest of their kind are
frequently a few old birds,&mdash;flocks of young, too, often contain a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">-54-</span>
sprinkling of old female birds,&mdash;such as may be supposed have
made the journey before; but it must be also borne in mind
that on dark or even starlight nights, when these movements
mostly take place, any guidance, even that of call-note, would be
futile at any but a very limited range.</p>

<p>Schedules, &amp;c., were sent to forty stations, the same number
as in previous years. We have received filled-in schedules
from thirteen stations.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The last five stations are now placed at the head of the W.
of England stations under Mr. P. Kermode. We are sorry to
find a falling off in the returns this year and would have liked
to know if any reason can be assigned for the same.</p>

<p>We have to thank Mr. McCulloch, at Kyleakin, for the careful
records of directions of flight of the species observed. These
are important, and a great assistance at arriving at conclusions.</p>

<p>At Skervuile, owing to an accident to his hand, no notes were
kept by Mr. Ewing for some time between July and September,
but fewer birds were seen than for many years back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">-57-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In autumn, at Monach, Kyleakin, Skerryvore,
Dhuheartach, Rhinns of Islay, Corsewall, Loch Ryan, Mull of Galloway.
No records at any stations till Oct. 11th, when three Fieldfares
were killed at Monach. An indication of a rush was apparent
all through October after that date of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> and other species,
more especially at Rhinns of Islay. Latest records on Nov. 22nd,
prior to which date many Blackbirds and Thrushes frequented
Corsewall for a week during a covering of snow; therefore
probably only a local movement. At Kyleakin Song Thrushes
and Blackbirds resided all winter up to January, 1883. In
October no great rush observable, but indications of the same
migration observable on the E. coast were noticed at Corsewall
on the 14th, and at Dhuheartach and Rhinns of Islay on 17th;
and a few Blackbirds and Thrushes showed at Skerryvore on
13th. Eight Song Thrushes were killed one night also at
MacArthur's Head, and a single male Blackbird was seen in the
garden at Monach on Nov. 1st. A rush of "small birds" took
place during October, but in no large masses, at MacArthur's
Head and Rhinns of Islay, and at Corsewall and southward.
Three species of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Spring records, as usual, are scanty; some five
records at five stations, <i>viz.</i>, Butt of Lewis, Skerryvore, Rhuvaal,
MacArthur's Head and Mull of Galloway. Earliest, March 9th
at Butt of Lewis; latest, on May 17th at MacArthur's Head,
mostly of single Wheatears. In autumn, a few records of
Wheatears from Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Rhuvaal, and Rhinns
of Islay: the earliest, Aug. 17th at Dhuheartach; latest, Oct.
16th; and an evident rush on Aug. 23rd at Rhinns of Islay, and
again on Sept. 10th at Skerryvore, where over 100 were seen on
the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of Robins one spring record at Skerryvore on
April 9th, a single bird resting; fair S.S.E. and haze. In
autumn, at Kyleakin, Skerryvore, Lismore, Skervuile and Little
Ross. Earliest, a single bird on Aug. 17th, at Skervuile; latest,
two at Kyleakin (where, however, Robins arrived on Nov. 15th, and
remained all winter up to close of schedule on Jan. 27th, 1883).
An evident rush took place at Butt of Lewis between Sept. 14th
and 30th, with Wrens on the 26th, and with Wagtails on the
28th, 29th, and 30th; in November, a few Robins, accompanied
by Wrens and Linnets, at Lismore on 11th; and in October one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">-58-</span>
Robin and one Wheatear, together, on 9th at Skerryvore. All
the records in August, September, and October accompanied by
easterly winds, the rush in September with N.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of Golden-crested Wrens one spring record
at Mull of Galloway, on March 8th and 9th, when "great
numbers" were round the lantern at midnight; wind S.W., light,
clear. In autumn, earliest, Sept. 21st, at Corsewall, and 22nd and
25th at Loch Ryan; latest, and rush at Corsewall and Mull of
Galloway, on 15th and 16th, when "great numbers" round
lantern; strong E. and haze; straggling birds also, 8th and 9th,
at same places. A significant record is on Oct. 10th, at Rhinns
of Islay, north of which station we have no records. On that
date eight Golden-crested Wrens struck and one was killed;
wind light S.E., haze. The similarity of dates of occurrence at
Mull of Galloway on W. coast and Isle of May on E. coast this
year worthy of notice (see <a href="#General_Remarks1">General Remarks</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of Titmice only two spring records, both at Mull of
Galloway; five killed at midnight, March 18th, and great numbers
flying round lantern on May 22nd; wind light E. Note approximation
of dates on W. and E. coasts (see <a href="#General_Remarks1">General Remarks</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of Wrens one spring record at Skerryvore;
two flying about rock on May 24th; wind light N.W., clear. In
autumn one on Sept. 22nd, at Lismore. Latest, Nov. 11th, a few
at Lismore, and a partial rush on Oct. 8th, 9th and 11th, at
Corsewall, and on Oct. 11th and 26th at Lismore, the two latter
accompanied by Starlings and Robins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In autumn three Wagtails at Skerryvore, on
Aug. 28th, two&mdash;male and female&mdash;in a garden at Kyleakin,
and a few on each day at Lismore, on Oct. 28th, 29th, and 30th,
with light N.E. winds. Of Pipits, four struck and two were
killed at Butt of Lewis, in strong W. breeze, on March 17th;
they were accompanied by Tree Sparrows. In autumn, hundreds
round the Little Ross on Sept. 6th, after 8 p.m., for two hours;
one killed at 12 noon, in light N. breeze, clear, at Dhuheartach,
on Oct. 28th. It is not often they are recorded as killed in the
daytime in clear weather. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;An unusual number
of Pied Wagtails&mdash;fifty or more in one flock&mdash;on Sept. 25th, in
Kirkcudbright (J. J. Armistead, Esq.); also two Motacilla flava
seen on Sept. 11th,&mdash;a very rare occurrence at Douglas Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hirundinid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Swallows: Spring records at Kyleakin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">-59-</span>
Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Lismore, Corsewall, and Loch Ryan.
Seen first on April 12th at Corsewall, and April 15th at Loch
Ryan, where fifteen Swallows arrived with light N. wind and
sleet. Latest records on June 15th at Lismore, and 9th at
Skerryvore; not seen at Dhuheartach till May 14th. Other
records at Lismore on 10th, a flock, and 13th, another flock.
In autumn, one Swallow rested on window of lighthouse at
Dhuheartach, on Aug. 11th, and a final movement was observed
in September about the 14th and 15th, at Loch Ryan and
Mull of Galloway, besides a few other records at earlier dates.
<i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Swallow first seen at Douglas Hall, Dumfriesshire
on 7th. Mr. Howard Saunders, residing at St. Jean de Luz, in
the Basses Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, saw the first Swallow on March 25th, along
with many Wheatears and Redstarts. Woodcocks had passed
but in small numbers, and only two were seen in the market.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fringillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Tree Sparrows seen at Butt of Lewis on Feb.
20th, when four struck and two were killed; strong E. wind and
haze. Again six were seen at same place and two killed on
March 20th; and again six at the same place and one killed, on
April 8th. House Sparrows are recorded on May 27th, at
Skerryvore, flying about; and at MacArthur's Head&mdash;a number
all day&mdash;on May 8th. House Sparrows were also seen at Butt
of Lewis on Feb. 25th, with strong S.W. breeze, haze, and rain.
In autumn, House Sparrows, a large flock at Lismore on Oct.
24th; "Finches" on Oct. 10th, at Sound of Mull; Linnets, a
rush about 7th and 11th at Lismore, with a few earlier records;
and on Dec. 29th, at Monach, where all left on the 20th. Some
of these records probably apply to Grey Linnets, and the Monach
one likely to Twites or "Mountain Linnets." Four, possibly five,
species. <i>Land Notes.</i>&mdash;Four Siskins seen on sand-hills on Solway
Firth, on a patch of thistles; gone next morning, Oct. 17th
(J. J. Armistead.) Mr. Scot Skirving, of Edinburgh, mentions,
in lit., that the Chaffinch, was the most common of small birds
in Islay prior to the terrible winter of 1878, but after that very rare
indeed, until on Oct 22nd, 1880, a flock of some thousands appeared,
and since then they have again been fairly abundant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Two Snow Buntings were seen at Butt of
Lewis on March 21st. Autumn records: Snow Bunting Oct.
15th at Kyleakin, to Dec. 12th at Butt of Lewis. No rush apparent
and records scanty; three or four in all in October and November.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span>
One Yellow Bunting on Oct. 15th, at Kyleakin. Two or three
records at Dhuheartach also in October, November and December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In end of migration of 1881-82, under date
Jan. 12th, 16th, 1882, and 18th, large parties of Larks are recorded
at Lismore; wind light S. No more records till autumn, 1882.
On Sept. 27th, at Corsewall, one on lantern. Latest date,
Dec. 27th, at Skerryvore, two found dead; light S.S.W. and
clear. Records of direction of flight usually S.E., but these
records are, as are too often the case, too meagre to assist us.
Direction of flight is earnestly asked for. A rush distinguishable
at Rhinns of Islay on Oct. 8th and 12th. Two Larks remained
all night on lantern at Dhuheartach, on Jan. 2nd, 1883.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Starling: in spring a large flock on March
11th at Butt of Lewis, but they are resident here, and rarely
come to the light; two were killed here, however, on June 7th.
A record at Mac Arthur's Head; great scarcity of records of
Starlings. A few autumn records only; numbers feeding for
days at Rhinns of Islay, end of August. A rush apparently took
place at Mac Arthur's Head, along with many "small birds,"
between first week of October and 31st. Records scattered through
November, December, and January (1883).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corvid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;"Black Crows" (probably Rooks?) which are
seldom seen at Skerryvore, showed in March, when three were
seen one day, and one rested on May 29th, and a "Grey Crow"
on 16th. In autumn, "Black Crows," a large flock during
snow, seen flying E. at Portpatrick on Dec. 14th. One Hooded
Crow on 26th at Monach, flying S.W. One Raven at Kyleakin
on 5th, flying S., light N.E. wind; and one Magpie ("very rare"
at Kyleakin) on Jan. 7th, 1883, flying S.E. One Jackdaw rested
on the rock on Feb. 11th (1883), and on the 19th two "Black
Crows "were seen flying in an easterly direction; wind S.W.,
fresh and clear.</p>

<p class="caption3nb" id="General_Remarks1">General Remarks.</p>

<p>A vast migration took place this year upon our E. coast, the
heaviest waves breaking upon the entrance to the Firth of Forth,
at the Isle of May station, and again at Pentland Skerries. Bell
Rock came in also for a share, though apparently, from the
schedules, a much smaller one than at the Isle of May. The
easterly winds prevailed all along our E. coast, generally strong
to gales, and the successions of south-easterly and easterly
gales in October, between the 8th and 23rd, occurring as they
did, just at the usual time of the principal migration, brought
vast numbers of land-birds to our shores. From Faroe in the
north to the extreme south of England this is found to have
been the case, but the usual blank on our Scottish coast occurs,
over a large extent of shore-line, from Dunnet Head, in Caithness,
all the way to Bell Rock. From all this great stretch
of coast, embracing no less than ten lighthouse stations, I
have only two schedules returned. These two schedules respectively
are from Cromarty, a closely landlocked station, and
the other from Chanonry, a still more completely landlocked
station,&mdash;both absolutely sheltered, as it were, from the track
of the great S.E. and easterly gales; I may therefore say that I
have not a single statistic of direct value, between Dunnet Head
and Bell Rock, as regards the general migration. My thanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">-64-</span>
are none the less due, however, to Mr. Ritson, of Cromarty, and
to Mr. McGill, of Chanonry, as their notes will, without doubt,
prove of value if continued, and will assist us in arriving
at conclusions regarding more local movements of birds, dependent
upon food and shelter, which may prove none the less
interesting because of their connection with landlocked positions.
The absence of returns from this great stretch of coast-line is
much to be deplored, and at present I am perfectly unable to
state whether it is due entirely to absence of birds at all these
stations every season, which, however, I can hardly think is the
case, or if it is lack of interest at some of these stations. If the
latter, we can only say we regret that we have failed to arouse
sufficient interest in our subject. I cannot pass over this without
the one further remark, that if the lighthouse-keepers at
these stations would only return the schedules, with even a
<i>negative</i> statement, <i>every year</i>, it would facilitate our work. <i>The
absolute knowledge, that year after year no birds are seen at these
stations would be as valuable to us as positive data.</i> By a chance
visit to Buchan Ness&mdash;one of these stations&mdash;on the Aberdeenshire
coast, I learned that a Manx Shearwater was once captured
at the lights, and saw the specimen, and thus it was added to the
Aberdeenshire fauna, besides being an extremely rare visitant to
any portion of the E. coast. Had this been returned in a
schedule, I would have been doubly grateful for dates and circumstances
of the occurrence at the time. While I am on the
subject of addressing our reporters <i>let me once more earnestly
request them, in every case where possible, to state the directions in
which migratory flocks of birds are seen flying. This would greatly
facilitate our deductions from year to year; and especially would I
ask attention to this at all the more northerly stations, and all the
west coast stations</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps not the least remarkable migration was that of
<i>Regulus cristatus</i> (the Golden-crested Wren), extending in one
broad wave from Faroe southward along the whole coast, coming
with S. to S.E. to E. winds, reaching the Scottish stations by
Aug. 27th, and continuing to November 12th, but apparently not
reaching Faroe till Oct. 21st, when a great rush took place. It
is worthy of remark also that they were unusually abundant at
Isle of May in spring, a rush taking place in March, and
of females on March 10th. The stream in autumn, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">-65-</span>
Scotch coasts, lasted from 8th to 23rd, but did not begin in
Faroe till 20th or 21st. A vast general rush of many other
species reached our coasts also between Oct. 8th and 23rd. The
great waves of <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> scarcely seem to have reached Faroe, as
we have only a few records of them thence in December, and the
same remark may be held to apply to many other species
mentioned.</p>

<p>It is also important to note, that while so abundant at the
outlying station of Isle of May and Bell Rock on the E. coast,
there should have been an almost complete absence of any
of these species at the next station, a little higher up the Firth
of Forth, <i>viz.</i>, at Inch Keith; and to record that it appears to be
always with westerly winds that birds occur there. While there
were hundreds of records at Isle of May, there were none with
the same winds at Inch Keith, and only about ten records in all.
Its somewhat landlocked position accounts for this, and its being
sheltered from the S.E. winds places it on a similar footing with
Chanonry and Cromarty, in the Moray Firth. Weather.&mdash;Upon
our E. coasts, easterly and south-easterly winds prevailed
throughout the greater part of the migratory seasons, both in
spring and autumn, and reached forces of from fresh to gales.
On the W. coast the wind was for the most part westerly and north
westerly, rarely S. during spring, at the greater part of the
stations, and was easterly and south-easterly in autumn, seldom
reaching fresh or strong, or gales, as on the E. coast, usually
light, or from light E. or S.E. to variable. The above facts will
be considered, whilst we state next the distribution of the
migratory waves on the W. coast, in relation to those on the E.
coast. As in 1881, records on the W. coast begin to bulk more
largely towards the southern stations. All north of Rhinns
of Islay and MacArthur's Head the records of land-birds are
very scanty, and the lighthouse keepers remark upon the scarcity.
At usually (normally) crowded stations, such as Skervuile, they
are reported as yielding "fewer birds than for many years back."
Even at Rhinns of Islay the records are not large, but they
begin to show an increase at this point. Unfortunately I have
no autumn returns between Rhinns of Islay and Corsewall, which
latter is south of the Firth of Clyde.</p>

<p>Now, if anything additional to the general bulk of the records
is required to show the line of migration of 1882, it is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span>
significant record of the Golden-crested Wren at Rhinns of
Islay on Oct. 10th, and at Corsewall and stations to the south,
but nowhere to the north of the former station. Now, it seems
that the strong easterly to S.E. gales on our E. coast, which
brought over such streams (rather than rushes) of birds,&mdash;such
countless thousands,&mdash;did not carry them forward across the
breadth of Scotland to any appreciable extent, but that the birds,
tired and storm-tossed, rapidly sought rest and shelter on arrival;
and that we have only on the W. coast indications that such a
great stream broke upon the E. coast. These indications, however,
are strong enough to enable us to mark out, with some
degree of certainty, the lines and turning-points of the stream.</p>

<p>If we do this, by comparing the records of the various
schedules, we find that, south of the Firth of Clyde, the records
bulk most largely; and we also find that the dates agree with
those of the E. coast.</p>

<p>MacArthur's Head and Rhinns of Islay appear to me, from
the bulking of records, similarity of dates, continuance of light
E. winds, and species occurring, to represent the turning-point
of the autumn migration from E. to W. Rhinns of Islay is a
salient angle, catching glimpses of passing birds from N.W. to
S.E. Otherwise, if the strong gales did not cause all birds to
drop for shelter on Scotland, it must have carried many far out
over the Atlantic, as in 1880. Isle of May sends in 19 schedules,
and Pentland Skerries 8. Bell Rock sends 2&mdash;thickly filled&mdash;and
North Ronaldshay 3, but bulking less than Bell Rock. What
has become of the many birds passing through the Pentland
Firth? We find little indication of them at the nine northerly
W. coast stations. Have many overshot the land and passed out
over the Atlantic?</p>

<p>Another point worth noting, is the occurrence of many birds
in spring at the same stations frequented by the species in
autumn. Thus, at Mull of Galloway on March 8th and 9th,
with westerly winds. Goldcrests were abundant, and at the same
station on Oct. 15th and 16th, an autumn-rush took place, with
easterly and N.E. wind and haze. The same double records
occur at Bell Rock and Isle of May as regards many species, and
especially <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> and <i>Regulus cristatus</i>. This "returning"
upon old lines has already been remarked upon by my colleague,
Mr. J. Cordeaux, in our Third Report (p. 38). Since these last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span>
sentences were written, I have received the first of the 1883
schedules from the Isle of May, and may here state what the
effects of the succession of N.E. gales in March have been on the
spring migration, leaving however the details of Mr. Agnew's
schedules to be worked into our next&mdash;1883&mdash;Report. I give
this in Mr. Agnew's own words, as I entirely coincide with the
opinions expressed. Mr. Agnew writes on the back of the
schedule as follows:&mdash;"With reference to your note on the
schedules sent, as to the effect of the N.E. gale of March 6th,
7th, and 8th, 1883, you will see from the entries inside that the
effect of that gale was almost to stop migration at the Isle
of May. Migration that had set in pretty briskly on the 2nd
almost ceased on the 5th, and from that date we had only a few
stragglers of the strongest wings, up to the 19th. I believe the
effect of that gale was to drive the birds that should have come
this way, away to the southward. Had the gale been from the
S.E. it would have been different here."</p>

<p>In fact, a N.E. wind reaching such strengths as those
of March 1883 did, acts very much in the same way upon spring
migrants, pressing them more to the southward, as north-westerly
strong winds and gales act upon the autumn migrants, whose
normal course is from E. to W., or S. of E. to N. of W. It will
be interesting to trace this further from the schedules returned
from other stations, when they come in for 1883. Another point
to note in spring migration of 1883, will be the greater westering
of the return migrants, if we may use the expression, partly
consequent upon the greater westering of the autumn migrants,
caused by the long-continued and strong south-easterly winds
of the preceding autumn, and partly upon the north-easterly winds
of March pressing them down and deflecting their course to more
inland and sheltered lines.</p>

<p>In this connection I would speak here of the great assembly
of the Pied Wagtails on the narrow stone horizontal moulding
above the upper windows of the General Post Office, Edinburgh,
where, upon March 17th, 1883, A. B. H., who recorded the facts
in the 'Scotsman' of that date, counted more than sixty; and
he adds, in a subsequent letter to me, "there was at least one
in every niche of the carved capitols of the columns. I think I
am quite within the mark when I say there were 150 birds
altogether." This flock roosted there on March 17th and 18th,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span>
but disappeared on the 19th, owing, Mr. H. thinks, to a rise of
temperature and the wind going round from N.E. to S.E. Mr. H.
was informed that numbers, probably the same birds, were seen
feeding at Duddingstone Loch on the 18th. Now, several years
ago, a similar assemblage was noted at the same locality, by a
well-known Edinburgh ornithologist, but it occurred, not in spring
but in autumn, and a general movement was at that time also
noted by Mr. H., and recorded in the Proc. Ryl. Phyl. Soc. of
Edinburgh, on Jan. 15th, 1879, from which last noted records
of autumnal migration it would appear that he saw about seventy
Pied Wagtails on the roof a house in Edinburgh, in the middle
of September, 1878, and Mr. Scot Skirving, of Edinburgh, on a
previous occasion, saw some 300 at the General Post Office, but
the exact date of this latter record has unfortunately been lost or
mislaid, as we are unable, of course, to find out definitely the
meteorological phenomena accompanying the record.</p>

<p>Further, my friend Mr. Eagle Clarke, notes the arrival of the
same species in the neighbourhood of the Ure River, near
Masham, Yorkshire, as early as Feb. 5th, 1883. Though resident
in the lowlands about Leeds, it is migratory to and from
the higher lands. Mr. Eagle Clarke has often seen as many as
200 in a flock, on a large lawn near Leeds.</p>

<p>Mr. Agnew informs me, that with a S. wind there is little
migration past the Isle of May, and that S.E. is the best wind in
spring to permit of observations being made. Five Wagtails
were seen at Isle of May on the 29th and 30th, however, during a
gale from the S.</p>

<p>The Spring Migration of 1883 seems to me to indicate the
direct effects of the N.E. gale, causing these Wagtails to keep
inland by a more sheltered route, which Wagtails in ordinary
weather would probably have passed up the coast-line and
crossed the entrance of the Firth of Forth, showing themselves
at Isle of May and Bell Rock stations. Mr. Robert Gray has,
I believe, frequently observed the spring arrivals of this species
on the west coast&mdash;in Ayrshire; and it will be interesting to see
if we can trace the movement up the west coast, <i>on the returning
lines</i>, when schedules are returned for 1883, from Mull of
Galloway and other west coast stations.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon these facts because I believe that our
appreciation of the general lines and of the laws regulating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">-69-</span>
great annual migrations can be very greatly assisted by the study
of individual species on their migration, and good opportunities
are in this report afforded us of doing so by the records of several
species. One more remark:&mdash;It seems also worthy of note that
very possibly these Wagtails were finding their way <i>across</i>
Scotland from the Solway or the Clyde, and, resting on the
General Post Office buildings, repaired <i>south</i> for daily food&mdash;as
I have noticed birds do during the spring migration on the
Petchora, at Ust Zylma, and Habarika, in N. E. Russia; and on
the advent of a more favourable temperature and change of wind,
pursued their course northward. If these are correctly recorded
as Pied Wagtails,&mdash;as there is no reason to suppose is not so,&mdash;then
their destination would be the North of Scotland; but if
they were the White Wagtail or continental form, then, as far as
general records of migration guide us, they would probably <i>shoot
off</i> again at Isle of May or Bell Rock&mdash;towards the Continent.
Mr. Agnew's note of "very white Wagtails" at Isle of May
should be borne in mind in this connection (<i>antea</i>, p. 12).</p>

<p>That a line of migration does occur across Scotland both in
spring and autumn between Forth and Clyde, I think, needs
little demonstration beyond what we have already stated in
previous reports; both from data and by referring to General
Remarks this seems perfectly obvious. The evidences of the sea
having at one time advanced inland a long distance past the very
spot in which I now live can scarcely be gainsaid; and Forth
and Clyde&mdash;by two separate branches&mdash;must at one time have
approached one another very much more closely than they now
do, and a comparatively narrow isthmus have been formed by at
least one of these two branches. As already remarked, it is
curious to find rare American and rare eastern species occurring
so frequently at localities on that line; witness as the latest
record of importance that of the Pectoral Sandpiper, <i>Tringa
maculata</i>, Vieillot, at Loch Lomond, after continuous and scarcely
failing easterly winds, on Nov. 24th, 1882.</p>

<p>Sir Geo. Leith Buchanan informs me that he believes that
the wind was north-west at the time he shot the Pectoral Sandpiper,
but this was local, as prevailing winds were easterly at
that time. Sir George also tells me of the other birds of rare
occurrence which he has met with at the same locality, but no
notes at the time were taken of wind. These are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">-70-</span></p>

<p>"Buonapartian Gull, in April 1851 or 1852. Black-tailed Godwit,
April, about same date. Shoveller found breeding, and two
since shot by keeper. Two Wood Sandpipers, one in August and
the other on Oct. 4th. One Little Stint in October, seen in
company with two others. The Spotted Crake must breed, as
every autumn I meet with them when Snipe-shooting. The
Shrike I obtained once in December, 1866, and I saw another
two or three winters since." I think if we thus endeavour to
group together rare occurrences, and collect lists from various
localities, we cannot fail to arrive at some conclusions regarding
the highways of migration. We are thus working from data up
to facts, without an undue amount of theorising.</p>

<p>It is well known to naturalists that Swallows cross the Alps
by certain passes, as is also done by other species, regularly
year after year. People have often marvelled at the punctuality
of appearance of the Swallow and other species at certain
favourite resorts. There is nothing marvellous in it. When
the great general movement takes place, and the flights of birds
pass over old frequented and well-known spots, these are
recognised and promptly occupied by the hereditary occupants,
or, if found unoccupied by later migrants, they are then filled up.
This remark applies both in spring and autumn. In a former
Report I have instanced the arrivals of Wood Pigeons on the
Fife coast, and I have also instanced breeding-sites of birds
occupied for many years, unoccupied for two or more years,
and then reoccupied again. I am informed by Mr. A. B. Herbert
that some of the favourite alpine passes for the annual migration
of birds are the Albula and Bermina Passes into the
Adda Valley and Lake Como, returning the same way in
spring. If this regularity occurs during the passage of the
bulk of migratory birds, I think there are good reasons for
believing that a similar regularity appears in the distribution
along certain lines of rare visitants, even if travelled all the
way from America or the Asiatic steppes and tundras. No
doubt they get into the groove&mdash;so to speak&mdash;and carry on in
company with the main flocks of other species, joining issue with
them along the great highways of migration, which I think have
been well pointed out in many cases by Palm&eacute;n and Herr
Weissmann. Though the article by the latter has been
abundantly criticised and even pooh-poohed, I venture to record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span>
my firm belief that there is more in it than appeared on the
surface, and that the more we know of migration the more fully
will his theory be borne out.</p>

<p>It is known to naturalists that some species which are known
to breed in the highest northern latitudes travel on migration to
the furthest southern localities. Let us instance the Knot
(<i>Tringa canuta</i>). Temperature has to do with this directly.
What a vast breeding-ground of this species, as yet undiscovered,
must there be somewhere in the far north if we witness the great
streams on their annual migration along our coasts. In spring
they travel on and on towards the north until they find a
temperature cool enough for the successful hatching and rearing
of their young, reaching their far off summer quarters even before
insect-life has begun to show itself, after the long Arctic winter;
and, with the strength and vigour of a far northern-bred species,
they adapt themselves to the only food existing&mdash;the fronds of
lichen laid bare by the first melting of the snow. The hardiness
of the race, bred thus on the shores of the Arctic seas, induces
the vigour and "fitness" which enables them to travel so far
again to the southward in autumn and winter; and it is the
annual overflow of their vast numbers, pressing behind those in
the van, which&mdash;as it were&mdash;adds impulse to the ability, and
carries them forward. They press forward in autumn to fresh
feeding-grounds as those behind are taken up by others succeeding
them.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1882 forty schedules were forwarded to the
light-keepers, and in the autumn forty-one. Thirty-one stations
returned answers in the spring, and thirty-two in the autumn.</p>

<p>The same stations were selected as in the autumn of 1881,
with the exception of Dursey Island, which was substituted for
the Calf Rock; and Dungarvan, which was added in the autumn
of 1882.</p>

<p>Some improvement in filling the schedules is apparent. A
few errors in the identification of species probably have been
made, but no blame is attached to the light-keepers, who
gratuitously observe for us to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>In accordance with a desire expressed by the other members
of the Committee, and for the sake of uniformity, the observations
have been arranged under each species instead of under the day
of the month, and the light-stations are arranged geographically,
beginning at the Fastnet, in Cork, and going round by the east
and north to the west coast. The entries in the spring schedules
are placed first under each species.</p>

<p>The severe frost which visited these islands for about ten
days, beginning on December 6th, caused a local migration of
many land-birds to the sea-coast, and several entries occur in
the schedules at this time.</p>

<p>The weather observations taken by the light-keepers, when of
an ordinary character, have been sometimes omitted; but with
scarcely an exception every entry in the schedules, which refers
to the occurrence of a particular species on a given date, is
recorded.</p>

<p>The name given by the light-keepers to the birds is always
adopted, and generally without comment; but occasionally
inverted commas are used when it appears advantageous to
insert them.</p>

<p>Looking through the records, and comparing them with
reports from the English coast and elsewhere, it is evident that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>
Ireland lies comparatively out of the track of migrants, and its
western stations are especially poor.</p>

<p>The Tuskar Rock, on the Wexford coast, is certainly the best
station. Large numbers of migrants strike the lantern there,
and many are killed. Being the nearest land to the Welsh
coast, and the extreme south-eastern point of Ireland, the
Tuskar is well situated for observation.</p>

<p>A Snowy Owl was shot on the Island of Innishtrahull, off the
coast of Donegal, and forwarded by the light-keeper there to the
Museum of Science and Art, Keldare Street, Dublin.</p>

<p>Observations on Gulls and Gannets are numerous, and it is
difficult to estimate their value, as some light-keepers have given
them much attention, while others have scarcely noticed these
species owing to their frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>The presence of the Gannet all round the coast during the
breeding season would seem to show that a large proportion do
not breed. The little Skellig Rock, off the Kerry coast, is the
only Irish breeding-place of the Gannet; and when visited in
1880, by Mr. Barrington, there were scarcely thirty pairs
breeding.</p>

<p>In the returns many entries occur which probably do not
refer to migrating birds, but it has been thought prudent not to
omit any from the printed report.</p>

<p>It is remarked by some light-keepers that more birds strike
fixed than revolving or flash lights.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the great scarcity of Starlings in 1882
in several schedules.</p>

<p>Conclusions are premature for a year or two, and it is as well
to let the observations of the light-keepers speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Great results are not anticipated from this enquiry, but few
satisfactory ones will be forthcoming unless it be continued; it
is therefore essential that the light-keepers should assist us for
some years longer, and we trust they will do so.</p>

<p>To Captain Boxer, R.N., Inspector of Irish Lights, we are
again indebted for friendly aid; as well as to the Commissioners
of Irish Lights, who were good enough to take forty copies of
last year's report, and distribute them to the various observers.</p>

Sparrows, Linnets, Stonechats, Black Crows, White-backed
Crows, Golden Plover, Green Plover, Bald Coot, Curlew, Wild
Duck, Snipe, Redshank or Sandpiper, Starling (they have been
scarce), Blackbirds, Thrushes, Cormorants, Water Wagtails, one
Snow Bunting (very few this season).'"&mdash;John A. Murray.</p>

<p><i>Dunree Head.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Cormorants are here all the year
round; they build their nest under the lighthouse. They go up
the Lough every morning, and return in the evening. No birds
strike this light. Land-birds are very scarce."&mdash;John Stapleton.</p>

<p><i>Lough Swilly.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Birds seldom strike this lantern.
Barnacle Duck and Widgeon frequent the head of Lough Swilly
from about Oct. 1st to end of March."&mdash;Henry Redmond.</p>

<p><i>Arranmore.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The birds that breed on this island
are 'Stonechats,' 'Gulls,' 'Puffins,' 'Ravens,' 'Goldfinches,'
'Hawks,' and 'Red-legged Jackdaws' (Choughs). Autumn: This
station seems out of the line of passing birds."&mdash;Henry Williams.</p>

<p><i>Killybegs.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: The number of birds striking the
lantern has been very few since 1879; only the two named in the
schedule (Woodcock) have struck up to the present. The frost
and snow of 1879 made great havoc among Thrushes, Blackbirds,
Starlings, and Fieldfares. I saw no Starlings since 1881, which
is very unusual. In the spring of 1882 I saw two very fine
specimens of the Northern Diver; they remained until late in
summer. Puffins arrive in large numbers early in July, and
usually leave <i>en masse</i> towards the middle of August. Cormorants
muster pretty strongly in the autumn months. Several Grey
Gulls and four or five Black-headed remained here during the
present winter. I observed one Gull a few days ago of a dirty
white or creamy colour, no feathers of any other colour being
visible. The Sea Swallow, or 'Pirr Gull,' used to visit us in
thousands formerly; but since the autumn of 1878 not one has
been seen here. When stationed at the mouth of the Boyne, in
1876, a few of these birds used to breed there, laying their eggs
on the top of little sandy hillocks."&mdash;Daniel Hawkins.</p>

<p><i>Oyster Island, North.</i>&mdash;"Scarcely any land-birds visit this
island."&mdash;John Young.</p>

<p><i>Broadhaven.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: The Gannet does not breed on the
Stags, but is to be seen after herring."&mdash;Michael Duffy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span></p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, East.</i>&mdash;"Spring: did not observe any birds of
a migratory kind pass this island."&mdash;Robert W. Redmond.</p>

<p><i>Eagle Island, West.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: I have carefully watched
the movements of birds, and have not found anything worth
reporting. Sea-fowl occasionally after herring in large groups;
but they come and go no particular way."&mdash;Matthew Healy.</p>

<p><i>Clare Island.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Very few migratory birds at this
station in 1882, with the exception of Gulls, Guillemots, Puffins,
and Razorbills, of which large numbers arrived in the latter part
of March, and left on Aug. 18th. Cormorants and Kittiwakes all
the year round. Large numbers of Grouse from August to
January. Snipe and Woodcock, November to March. Two
large Eagles have their eyrie on the cliffs of a mountain close to
the lighthouse: they kill several lambs. Geese, Ducks, and
Hens, and carry them to the mountain with the greatest ease."&mdash;George
H. Brownell.</p>

<p><i>Slyne Head, North.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Very few land-birds visit
this station."&mdash;Robert Tyrrell.</p>

<p><i>Slyne Head, South.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The Tern used to arrive for
breeding perhaps about May 4th or 6th; this year they did not
come until June 4th, and not one bird hatched on the island this
year. Sea-hawks arrive the first week in April, and leave about
the end of October. I have not seen a Crow for two years, nor a
Starling this year."&mdash;William Callaghan.</p>

<p><i>Arran Island, North.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: No birds struck the lantern
in 1882. I have not observed any Blackbirds, Thrushes, or
Starlings, during the past year."&mdash;John Kelly.</p>

<p><i>Straw Island.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: All descriptions of birds were
fewer this year than usual."&mdash;Charles Boyle.</p>

<p><i>Arran Island, South.</i>&mdash;"Autumn: Only a few 'Stares' struck
the lantern this winter."&mdash;John O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Samphire Island.&mdash;"Spring: Not a single bird struck last
winter, the chief cause being that we have a red light all round
east and south, which birds never strike. Almost all birds strike
with S.E. winds, and generally on the east side of the lantern."&mdash;Michael
O'Donnell.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght Rock.</i>&mdash;"Spring: The Sea-parrots are so plentiful
here (April 25th) that on some occasions the whole island is
completely covered with them: they are just now beginning to
find their way into their holes. There is some solitary bird here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span>
so it seems, makes a noise so loud, or crows so loud, in the cliffs,
that one can hear it distinctly in the dwellings. It sounds something
as follows: 'kuck, kuck, ko, kuck, kuck, ko.' This is
repeated a few times, and then there is an interval of some
minutes. So far I can neither see nor hear it in the daytime.
It is called in this place the 'Night-bird.' (See 'Zoologist,'
January, 1883). The Sea-parrot does not lay more than one
egg unless it is taken away, when another is laid at the end of a
week, and if this is taken away another egg is laid; then no
more are laid that year. The young remain in their holes until
they are fully feathered. They leave them in July, and are well
guarded in the sea by the old birds. It is my opinion they do
not ascend on the island any more after they have left their
holes. The only way the young birds are distinguished from the
old ones the following spring is that their feet are still a little
black. The Razorbill begins to lay its egg about May 18th.
The parent birds relieve each other while hatching. I actually
saw one Razorbill come up to another which was on the egg,
peck it, when off it went, and the new comer at once took its
place. The Stormy Petrels breed here, but in small quantity.
Autumn: Referring to the cry of the 'Night-bird' (Manx Shearwater
), the letter 'a' should be added to the 'ko,' and it would
then read, 'kuck, kuck, ko-a.' The cry is as distinct as that of
the Cuckoo, and would be heard about the same distance. I
never remember to have seen a Crested Cormorant until I came
here. Starlings and Thrushes come off with easterly winds
when there is frost or snow on the mainland. About a dozen
Grey Linnets remained here during December; also a few Snow
Buntings. There are a couple of hundred Titlarks summer and
winter; they do not migrate. The same might be said of the
Common Wren; about a dozen."&mdash;Edward McCarron.</p>

<p><i>Valentia.</i>&mdash;"Spring: No bird struck this lantern for five
years. This point is too far west, and is out of the track of
migrating birds."&mdash;Thomas McKenna.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
